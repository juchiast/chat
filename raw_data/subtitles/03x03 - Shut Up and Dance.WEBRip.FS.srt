00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:43,966
Kenny? Big spillage on table four. Sorry.

4
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,806
Okay. All right.

5
00:01:57,887 --> 00:01:59,007
Excuse me.

6
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,723
Someone forgot this.

7
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:03,166
Oh, thank you!

8
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:05,886
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

9
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:09,046
- It's all right.
- She forgets everything. Thanks again.

10
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:20,446
She was some yoga teacher,
proper bendy. Look. Look.

11
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:26,403
Jesus! Fuck! What, she
sent that to you, did she?

12
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:27,566
Double naughty.

13
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:31,726
Jog on.

14
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:03,886
Linds!

15
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:07,011
Linds, where's my laptop?

16
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:12,123
- Don't be a bell end!
- Use your own.

17
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:15,643
- Mine's bust. Yours has gone all frozen.
- What did you do?

18
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,803
- I was trying to put on this film thing.
- What film thing?

19
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:20,803
Don't know. Some programme
lets you watch free films.

20
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,501
While I was trying to put it on,
then it locked up.

21
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:26,563
- Look, it's not my fault.
- Don't take it again. It's not yours.

22
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,924
- Oh, fix mine when you've done that.
- "Fix mine when you've done that."

_

26
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,740
- Stop nicking my Cokes!
- Whatever.

27
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,820
Did you draw that yourself, Kenny?

28
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,260
Thanks, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

29
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,075
Bye.

30
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,300
- Bye, Kenny.
- Bye, Kenny, I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,740
You're mental.

32
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,460
- You're mental.
- You're a thief.

33
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,140
Love? Kenny? What do you think?

34
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,697
- I'm still not used to the colour.
- It's nice.

35
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,860
Yeah?

36
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,100
Do me a favour and prison-guard
your sister, will you?

37
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,857
I won't be late. Probably.

38
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,697
Oh, my God! He's outside.
There's a lasagna thing in the freezer.

39
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
I love you.

Have you seen my keys?

53
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,180
You okay, Ken? Love?

54
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,257
Yeah, fine.

55
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,820
Ha!

56
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,940
- Morning, Kenny.
- Hi.

57
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,907

58
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,151

_

63
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,077
- Kenny?
- Feeling really sick.

64
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,000
- You've only just got here.
- I know but think I might throw up.

65
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,960
Okay, just next time can you...?

66
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,080
Whoa! Easy, knobber.

67
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,044

68
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,164

70
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,501
Come on.

71
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:46,708
- It's fragile.
- What is it?

72
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:53,828
They told me to do that.

73
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:02,611
Is that it? What do I do now?

74
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,054
I can't really help you.

75
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:13,851
What do I have to do?

76
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:16,534
Just whatever they say and once
you've done that, you're out.

77
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:18,294
They let you off.

78
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,017

79
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,681

_

81
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:34,014
Hello?

82
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:37,494
Del... Delivery.

83
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:40,374
Wrong room.

84
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:44,254
They said 121.

85
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:52,131
No, there's no delivery here.

86
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:54,574
- But they said...
- I haven't ordered anything.

87
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,014
It's a cake.

88
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,531
- What cake?
- I don't know. I think it's a sponge.

89
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:11,931
I didn't order a cake so
just take it back to the bakery

90
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,971
- and tell them they got it wrong.
- Look, if I...

91
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:18,334
I don't want the cake.
So go away or I call the front desk.

92
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,248
_

93
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:33,413
_

94
00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:44,171
I will kick that
cake up your fucking arse.

95
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:46,174
M-Mindy sent me.

96
00:18:56,574 --> 00:19:00,611
- What is this? Where's Mindy?
- I was just told to give this to you.

97
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:02,491
- Mindy told you?
- No.

98
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:04,811
- You said "Mindy."
- That's what they told me to say.

99
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:12,091
Get inside.

100
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:18,531
So what are you saying?
Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?

101
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:22,891
No, uh, I don't know.
It... they... it was them.

102
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,411
Them? They? Who the
fuck are you on about?

103
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,691
- The people.
- What fucking people?

104
00:19:27,694 --> 00:19:29,931
The phone people.
The people on the phone.

105
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:33,371
They told me to bring the cake,
and they're leaving texts on my phone,

106
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:36,051
- and then I do what they say.
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

107
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,811
Just breathe through your nose.

108
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:41,531
Through your nose. Okay?

109
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:46,254
Good. Now, just show me what
they said. On your phone.

110
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:51,054
- Show me the text.
- Okay, well, um... This.

111
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:55,054
- I should...
- Shut up. Just let me.

112
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,534
What the fuck is this?

113
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,854
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

114
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:08,691
- Who are you?
- I'm not them.

115
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:12,091
They send me messages,
and I do what they say.

116
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,494
Why? Why would you do that?

117
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:38,014
Is it them?

118
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,859
_

119
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:15,014
_

120
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,268
_

121
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:37,534
- They said I had to do that.
- Jesus Christ!

122
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,294
Okay, okay.

123
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:54,531
They're saying they just need
us to follow their instructions,

124
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:56,654
and everything will be okay. Okay?

125
00:21:58,374 --> 00:21:59,454
Shit!

126
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:04,934
They're saying we have to do it together.

127
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:09,094
- What do we have to do?
- Just take the cake somewhere.

128
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:13,091
They sent me an address.
A map coordinate thing.

129
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:16,574
- And there's a car we need to get.
- A car? What sort of car?

130
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:21,331
I don't know what sort of car.
They said it's in the car park outside.

131
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,694
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

132
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:26,414
Why both of us?

133
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,254
I don't know!

134
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:32,931
Just let me deal with my
fucking shoe, please.

135
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,457
_

136
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,562
What have they said?

137
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,094
They say, "Go with him.
Take the package."

138
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,047
Okay.

139
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:03,254
"V760 DHM."

140
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:07,494
V760 DHM.

141
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:11,371
I'm getting fucking
number blindness here.

142
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:12,494
That's it.

143
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:20,702
All right. They said the
keys are on the back. Okay.

144
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,611
Look, maybe you better
drive. Do you drive?

145
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:34,131
- I mean, I had a drink back there.
- I can't. I can... I can drive.

146
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:35,611
I'm still learning.
Haven't passed my test yet.

147
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,734
All right. Uh... You're navigating.

148
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,211
Okay, you've got a sat nav on your phone?

149
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:42,374
Yep.

150
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:45,851
Here it is. Punch that in.

151
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:49,291
It's a street somewhere out of town.
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

152
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,654
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

153
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:08,134
So I'm guessing they got some shit on
you that they're threatening to put out?

154
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:16,694
With me, it's...

155
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:21,614
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

156
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:25,211
I was waiting for a prostitute.

157
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,574
Escort, hooker, whatever
they call them now.

158
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:30,854
I got a family, which is great.

159
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:34,494
You get bored.

160
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,814
I mean, when I was young, I used to like...

161
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:42,851
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

162
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:44,891
For old times' sake, I don't know.

163
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:49,534
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

164
00:24:50,094 --> 00:24:52,854
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

165
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:58,051
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

166
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:00,211
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

167
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:02,811
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

168
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:06,451
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

169
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,931
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

170
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:11,411
Sucked up the whole hard
drive like an audit.

171
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:16,171
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

172
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:19,331
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

173
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,251
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

174
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:24,451
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

175
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:26,091
Custody, she'd win.

176
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:29,811
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

177
00:25:29,814 --> 00:25:32,411
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

178
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,734
They filmed me.

179
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:44,214
- Filmed you...
- Through my computer camera.

180
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:49,614
- What, like, filmed you?
- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

181
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:55,014
- Like sex?
- No. Like, you... you know.

182
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,014
Jerking off. Jerking off
to porn or something?

183
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,294
Well, everyone does that.

184
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:05,171
- The fucking pope probably does that.
- They're gonna put it everywhere.

185
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:06,931
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

186
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,811
- Oh, shit the fuck!
- What? What?

187
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,611
- How long's that light been on?
- What light?

188
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,894
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

189
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,096
I won't be a minute.

190
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:29,294
Unleaded. Unleaded.

191
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:32,898
Oh, bugger!

192
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,894
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

193
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:41,534
Have you got any money?

194
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,771
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

195
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,811
- Visa card...
- Just the number!

196
00:26:49,814 --> 00:26:52,134
- Uh... 3109.
- Okay, go!

197
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:57,334
Pump four!

198
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,254
- What's your pump number?
- Four.

199
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:25,374
- You want some chocolate?
- No.

200
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:28,094
- It's two for one this week.
- I'm okay.

201
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,254
31.89.

202
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:36,894
Pop your PIN in.

203
00:28:03,254 --> 00:28:05,931
- If you're sure you don't mind?
- No, no, of course not.

204
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:10,651
- I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
- Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

205
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:13,731
- Okay.
- Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

206
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,734
Okay.

207
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:20,374
This is, uh...

208
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:24,171
my nephew.

209
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:25,614
Nice to meet you.

210
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:29,054
- Kenny.
- Kenny. I'm Karen.

211
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:32,294
We're both Ks.

212
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:37,411
I'm head of the PTA at Theo and
Cassie's school, for my sins.

213
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:41,814
Just roped poor Hector into sorting
out the catering for the quiz night.

214
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,531
Been the usual balls up.

215
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:45,731
Listen, we better get this
guy to the station.

216
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:48,371
His train's... So we better go.

217
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,171
- Cansroad Station?
- Yeah.

218
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:53,371
Oh, couldn't drop me at the
end of my road, could you?

219
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:54,774
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

220
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,331
It's the bus otherwise and that
goes all the way around the common.

221
00:28:57,334 --> 00:29:00,731
- We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
- Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

222
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:04,494
I'll hop out. Hardly need
to slow down. Yeah?

223
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:10,454
- Yep. Sure. Let's go.
- Brilliant. Thanks!

224
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:12,174
I'll just get in the back.

225
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:18,091
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

226
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:20,014
- What's that? Present?
- It's a cake.

227
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:24,894
- It's just a... it's a cake for Penny.
- Oh, lucky her.

228
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:30,051
So how is Penny?

229
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:33,214
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

230
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:35,651
She's good.

231
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:38,931
- She still planning to get back to work?
- Yeah. Yep.

232
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,989
_

233
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:45,654
- I mean, how old's Theo now?
- Uh... He's seven.

234
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,309
_

235
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:51,491
He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

236
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:53,174
Yeah, he had a good time.

237
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,309
_

238
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,651
Oh, Anna's
having a sleepover.

239
00:29:57,654 --> 00:30:00,091
Cassie's probably
already told you about it.

240
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:03,971
Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad!

241
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,020
_

242
00:30:11,294 --> 00:30:12,854
So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

243
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:16,934
- Sorry. What?
- Are you going home or...?

244
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:19,614
- Uh...
- Train. Birmingham.

245
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,771
Yeah. Uh...

246
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:25,891
- Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
- Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

247
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:27,491
- What part are you?
- South.

248
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,054
South.

249
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,771
- Mainly.
- Right.

250
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:34,931
_

251
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,611
Have you always lived there?
'Cos you don't sound...

252
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:38,811
I don't have the accent, no.
Everyone says that...

253
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:41,291
That... I don't have the accent.

254
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:46,651
Didn't grow up there though.
I grew up somewhere else.

255
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:49,731
Like London. I grew up in London.

256
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:50,894
Okay.

257
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:55,771
And is your mum and dad on
Hector's side or Penny's?

258
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:06,171
Someone crossing! Crossing!

259
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:14,294
Sorry about that! Can't miss his train.

260
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,934
This is me.

261
00:31:35,214 --> 00:31:37,851
Great to meet you, Kenny.
Give my best to Penny, won't you?

262
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,491
- Yes, of course.
- Bye, then.

263
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,054
- Bye, Karen.
- Bye.

264
00:31:57,174 --> 00:31:58,454
We're gonna make it, okay?

265
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:01,174
It's this junction.

266
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:03,934
- What? This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:22,828
You sure this is it?

268
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:27,774
"Look in the cake."

269
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:33,454
Let's look in the cake.

270
00:32:42,614 --> 00:32:44,014
Look in the cake.

271
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,894
In the cake, I suppose.

272
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:02,214
I got something.

273
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:12,257
What the fuck?

274
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:22,054
Oh, my God.

275
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,851
"Five minutes to decide."

276
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:34,691
Decide what?

277
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:41,014
- "Who is driver?"
- "Who is robber?"

278
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:53,291
_

279
00:33:54,254 --> 00:33:56,211
Oh, no. No.

280
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:59,054
- W-w-we can't. We...
- I'm driver.

281
00:34:01,494 --> 00:34:03,414
You said you can't drive. I'm driver.

282
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:06,214
I'll be right here with
the engine running.

283
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:08,931
We... We can't. We...

284
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:11,211
Then how else are we gonna
deal with this, Kenny?

285
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:12,691
- I'm not...
- Listen to me.

286
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:14,734
- I'm not...
- Shut up and listen!

287
00:34:16,294 --> 00:34:19,331
Hat and sunglasses.
No one's going to ID you.

288
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:21,851
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.
That's point one.

289
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:26,571
Shut up!
Point two, in a robbery, staff are trained.

290
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:27,611
I am not...

291
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:30,291
They are trained to hand over the cash.

292
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:34,051
No argument. I saw it in a documentary.
No resistance. It looked easy.

293
00:34:34,054 --> 00:34:35,211
It's not easy.

294
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:40,214
I know it isn't easy, but what the
fuck else are we gonna do? Hey?

295
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:45,211
This gets out, I will lose my kids.

296
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:48,011
And I swear to God,
I will stand in the kitchen

297
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:51,054
and put a fucking bread knife
through my throat if that happens.

298
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:55,854
- I only looked at pictures and...
- And beat one off on camera?

299
00:34:57,134 --> 00:34:58,534
That's what they got, yeah?

300
00:34:59,774 --> 00:35:04,534
Your hot little face, blurred fist,
dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?

301
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:09,651
Your mum's gonna love that on Facebook,
Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever.

302
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:12,174
And her friends. All eyes
on you, giving it that.

303
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:16,571
Toss in the cunts at work,
calling you Spurty McGoo.

304
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:19,451
Laughing at your come face,
making it their desktop wallpaper.

305
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:21,371
It's not just weeks.
We're talking years here.

306
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:24,211
Pictures hang about on Google
like a gypsy fucking curse.

307
00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:26,691
There's no cure for the Internet.
It would never go away.

308
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:29,734
It'd be glued to your name,
a fucking stain on you.

309
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:32,131
I'd hang myself if that was me.

310
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:34,294
Crack my fucking neck at
the first opportunity.

311
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:45,771
They just want the money,
so go in there and do it.

312
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:49,531
- You'll drive away.
- I am not gonna drive away.

313
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:51,854
I'm gonna be sat here
with the engine running.

314
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:54,811
I can't. I can't.

315
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:58,014
- You can. You can.
- I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

316
00:35:58,894 --> 00:36:00,251
- You can.
- I can't.

317
00:36:00,254 --> 00:36:02,574
We don't have much time, Kenny.

318
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:09,451
- It's not real. This is not real.
- You can do this.

319
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:13,571
Keep it together. Please hold it together.

320
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:17,094
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!
- Okay.

321
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:23,254
Have you got a bag?

322
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:28,014
Glasses. Breathe through your nose.

323
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:21,014
Give me money.

324
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:30,971
Just give me money!

325
00:37:30,974 --> 00:37:36,451
- Yes. Okay.
- Lots of it. I need lots of it.

326
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,494
Sh-should I use your bag?

327
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:43,414
Take it.

328
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:59,094
I'm going to pass this
back to you now. Is that okay?

329
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:36,971
There was some bloke standing
there on his phone freaking me out.

330
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:38,654
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

331
00:38:48,054 --> 00:38:49,531
Go faster.

332
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:52,414
Speed limit's 40. Wanna
get stopped for speeding now?

333
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:02,894
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck!

334
00:39:15,694 --> 00:39:17,051
That's a siren.

335
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,654
Shh! Shush.

336
00:39:25,294 --> 00:39:27,454
- Let's go!
- Shut up.

337
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:32,334
Wait, wait.

338
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:34,814
Come on.

339
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,254
Come on.

340
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:39,614
Okay.

341
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:09,774
We're okay.

342
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:13,814
We should text them, no?
Tell them we got the money.

343
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:23,214
- They say we got to take it somewhere.
- Where?

344
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:43,414
This is it.

345
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:45,414
Yeah.

346
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,854
Here we go.

347
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:53,528
"Final instruction."

348
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:56,734
"Take car away and destroy."

349
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:01,134
Destroy the car.

350
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:03,254
"Just you alone."

351
00:41:06,374 --> 00:41:09,014
Why just you?

352
00:41:09,964 --> 00:41:12,243
_

353
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:13,965
_

354
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:20,134
I got to take the money
somewhere over there.

355
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:25,054
Why? Why have I got to do it?

356
00:41:26,574 --> 00:41:28,374
Fuck knows.

357
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:30,948
_

358
00:41:30,974 --> 00:41:32,094
So...

359
00:41:35,414 --> 00:41:36,654
You better go, yeah?

360
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:43,014
Hey, you got this far, haven't you?

361
00:41:44,654 --> 00:41:48,454
Just drop it off. That's it.

362
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:50,664
You'll be all right.

363
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:07,411
Hey, listen, Kenny. Look.
I'm sorry about... just back there.

364
00:42:07,414 --> 00:42:10,174
Shouting at you. Calling you stuff.

365
00:42:11,254 --> 00:42:15,134
I'm an all right bloke really.
I swear I am, when it's...

366
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,254
When stuff's normal.

367
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:22,334
You take care, yeah?

368
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:25,783
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, hang on.

369
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,214
They told me I had to
set this thing off first.

370
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:58,614
Okay.

371
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:01,614
You got the prize money?

372
00:45:02,894 --> 00:45:06,974
- Prize money?
- You know, for the... fight?

373
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,374
How is there a fight?

374
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:13,134
- They didn't tell you?
- No.

375
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,734
We've got to fight...

376
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:22,614
...or else they post
everything they've got on us.

377
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:25,254
Winner takes the money.

378
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:30,574
We've got to do it.

379
00:45:32,014 --> 00:45:34,051
I mean...

380
00:45:34,054 --> 00:45:35,454
They're watching.

381
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:43,654
What sort of fight?
How do we know when it's over?

382
00:45:45,254 --> 00:45:47,014
How... How do we know who's won?

383
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:59,091
I don't know about you,
but my life's over if this gets out.

384
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:03,014
Fucking over.

385
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:09,974
What they get you for?

386
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:12,971
I just looked at some photos.

387
00:46:12,974 --> 00:46:15,651
That's all.
I just looked at one or two photos.

388
00:46:15,654 --> 00:46:18,051
Yeah.

389
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:20,614
Yeah, yeah, I just
looked at pictures too.

390
00:46:23,854 --> 00:46:27,374
How young were they? In the pictures?

391
00:46:29,774 --> 00:46:31,734
How young?

392
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:37,774
Yeah.

393
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,654
Well, me too.

394
00:46:58,894 --> 00:47:02,054
Look, mate. Don't. Please.

395
00:47:03,614 --> 00:47:04,894
Please.

396
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:06,894
Please.

397
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,811
Mindy?

398
00:49:40,454 --> 00:49:41,771
Is that what you've become?

399
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:43,971
- A dirty, sick, disgusting pervert?
- Hey, relax!

400
00:49:43,974 --> 00:49:46,731
Look at me! Is that what you are?

401
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:01,109
_

402
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:08,291
What did you do, Kenny?
They're saying it's kids!

403
00:50:08,294 --> 00:50:10,491
That you've been looking at kids!

404
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:13,931
And Lindsey saw it.
There's a video of you.

405
00:50:13,934 --> 00:50:17,531
All of her friends have got it!

406
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:20,854
Kids, Kenny! Tell me that's not true!

407
00:50:57,174 --> 00:51:02,574
