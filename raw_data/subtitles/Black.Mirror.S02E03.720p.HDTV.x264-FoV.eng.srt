2
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,629
Ahem.

3
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:37,632
They're ready for you.

4
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:42,052
Gwendolyn Harris. We've met.

5
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:43,290
Bournemouth.

6
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,011
But you don't know the others.

7
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,130
No, but I'm familiar with you.

8
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,650
Why do you want to be an MP?

9
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,129
Because I'm not satisfied
with the way things are,

10
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,411
and rather than sit back and moan
I'd prefer to do something about it.

11
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:57,729
Go again from the top.

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,249
I don't know why anyone's surprised
the world's number one teen idol

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,809
has become a Scientologist.

14
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,369
Speed up the autocue, please.

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,529
Pop stars do believe in weird things.

16
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,929
'Abba believed in angels.
R Kelly believed he could fly...'

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,169
They said show you this.

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,651
This happened just now?

19
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:13,330
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,810
Gladwell?

21
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,529
"Shamed Tory Jason Gladwell
resigns," - capitals -

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,449
"over Twitter porn pics scandal."

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,969
Oh, so he wasn't hacked after all.

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,249
"Originally claimed
his account had been hacked,

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,249
"resignation statement admits
inappropriate correspondence

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,449
"with a 15-year-old girl."

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,449
So tweeting dick photos
is correspondence now, is it?

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,369
"Departure triggers a by-election

29
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,809
"in his Stentonford and Hersham
constituency."

30
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,331
Well, you get to use
the Gladwell stuff.

31
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:37,370
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,611
Bump it all up to
the top of the monologue.

33
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:41,291
Anyone seen Jamie?

34
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:48,170
Rach?

35
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:50,449
'You really shouldn't be
calling me any more.

36
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,171
'You need to sort yourself out.'

37
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,690
I am.

38
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:56,171
'Focus on Waldo,
that's going well for you.'

39
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,450
But it is not...

40
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,330
'He's a hit, Jamie.'

41
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,810
"He." Not me, "he".

42
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:03,450
'Just do your show.'

43
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,291
I will. I mean, hon,
if you'd just...

44
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:08,091
Jamie?

45
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,851
Jamie, hurry up.

46
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:14,371
What do you know about
Stentonford and Hersham?

47
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:16,090
Safe Tory seat.

48
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:19,531
So, realistically, I know there's
not much of a chance, but...

49
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:22,370
So, it's a stepping stone for you?

50
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,931
Yes.

51
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:28,529
Obviously, I wouldn't say
that outside of this room,

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,609
but, well,
you want me to be honest.

53
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,329
There's no point in pretending.

54
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,731
Is there anything in your past that
might conceivably cause problems?

55
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:38,131
No.

56
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:40,971
Except...

57
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,731
I did commit a series
of murders in Huddersfield

58
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,730
between 1999 and 2003.

59
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,331
But apart from that...

60
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,610
Well, thank you, Gwendolyn.

61
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:56,531
If you could leave via that door.

62
00:02:56,532 --> 00:02:58,290
Oh, that door?

63
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,331
We like to keep
the candidates separate.

64
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:02,891
Right, yes.

65
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:17,091
Idiot. Idiot!

66
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:22,171
Shamed super groomer and all-round
pillock of the community

67
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:25,290
Jason Gladwell
has resigned as an MP,

68
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,970
saying he could no longer
maintain his position.

69
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:31,251
That position, presumably,
being hunched over

70
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,450
wanking madly at school kids.

71
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:34,971
'A pal of Gladwell said...'

72
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:35,890
You ready?

73
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,170
Uh-huh.

74
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,290
How old the girl wasn't.

75
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,929
That's the sort of feeble excuse

76
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,649
'only a naive school kid
would swallow -

77
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,531
'which, presumably, was the idea.

78
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,569
'Anyway, the bad news is
he's resigned in disgrace.'

79
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,811
The good news is he's now
free to pursue a full-time career

80
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,491
in the disgraced paedophile
industry.

81
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:59,651
Personally, I don't understand
why anyone's surprised...

82
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,930
Um, small change to the intro.

83
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,010
What?

84
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,089
- Nothing huge, Conor wanted the Jacko
gag for the monologue, so...
- That was my bit.

85
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,809
- There is the Chancellor stuff,
you could use that.
- Bit politics.

86
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,691
You can do politics.

87
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,210
I do piss-taking.

88
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:12,330
Go be Waldo.

89
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:13,530
Yes, commander.

90
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:15,449
'R Kelly believed he could fly,

91
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,771
'and Michael Jackson believed
that his doctor was qualified...'

92
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,850
Big ball blue bear bollocks.

93
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:22,649
And now it's time
for our final visit

94
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,089
to the world of educational
children's programming

95
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,689
courtesy of everyone's favourite,

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,091
and only occasionally inappropriate
cool kids' TV character,

97
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:31,451
Waldo.

98
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:36,970
Whose mum's in tonight, apparently.

99
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,731
Waldo, who have you had
in your cave this week?

100
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:43,090
Well, Conor,
in my big pink cave this week

101
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,089
I had former Minister
for Culture Liam Monroe.

102
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,011
Oh, he's quite handsome, isn't he?

103
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,290
I was hoping he'd nosh me off!

104
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,091
Want to see how it panned out?

105
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,730
I think we should.

106
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,091
Run VT!

107
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,410
Hey, everybody!

108
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:11,370
It's Waldo time!

109
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,850
Yeah!

110
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,410
Cool! Cool!

111
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:17,370
Waldo-rrific!

112
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,770
Ha-ha-ha!

113
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:22,250
Hey, kids,
my guest this week is Mr Monroe.

114
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,850
Hello, Mr Monroe.

115
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:25,130
Hello, Waldo.

116
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:28,291
Mr Monroe is a politician.

117
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:34,930
So, what is a politician, Mr Monroe?

118
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,849
Well, a politician is someone

119
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,531
who tries to make the
world a fairer place.

120
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,090
Like Batman.

121
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,050
Not exactly like Batman.

122
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,890
Do you beat people up?

123
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,329
No, I don't beat people up.

124
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,851
Oh, you're a pussy then?

125
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:51,651
Well, I'm not sure
I know exactly what...

126
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,211
You don't know what pussy is?

127
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,491
OK, this is clearly
some kind of joke.

128
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,090
No joke, sorry, let's move on.

129
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,371
Friends again?

130
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,450
Oh, hello, mate, great show.

131
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:16,609
Well done, really good.

132
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,849
So, we'll bring him over.

133
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,689
You go and get him,
I'll explain about...

134
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,291
'Now, he comes across...'

135
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:22,810
Jamie!

136
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,850
What you want, Miss Tamsin?

137
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,009
Behind me, man in glasses
talking to Jack Napier.

138
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,089
- Jack freaks me out.
- Yeah, ditto,

139
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,410
but he owns the company and the man he's
with is important and wants to talk to you.

140
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:34,930
He's from the channel.

141
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,490
Go on.

142
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:38,649
- 'Honestly, all I'm saying...'
- 'Is he shy?'

143
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,889
'No, all I'm saying is
he's a terrific guy...'

144
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,131
Jim, Jamie, Jamie, Jim.

145
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:43,250
How do you do?

146
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,450
Jim, Jack, James.

147
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,770
Jamie.

148
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:48,210
Jim was just talking about Waldo.

149
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:51,211
Yeah. Liam Monroe
has lodged a complaint.

150
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:53,690
Toys out the pram.

151
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,050
And that's...?

152
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,410
Good press.

153
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:58,649
It's so tough to get
a breakthrough these days,

154
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,329
but when it does,
well, it's just fantastic.

155
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,769
It's fantastic the way Waldo puts
the piss up Monroe.

156
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,051
You know, all those twats,
it's punk, it's... it's...

157
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,410
'Jack?'

158
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,771
Excuse me.

159
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:14,531
Well, Twitter can't get
enough of Waldo, loves him.

160
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:19,051
Look, I know the show's
coming back again next year,

161
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:21,451
but we want to see more of Waldo.

162
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,011
They want to do a pilot.

163
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:25,970
A Waldo pilot?

164
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:28,131
Yeah. I mean, how does that sound?

165
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,290
Yeah. Sounds good.

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,490
Sounds stormin' Norman,
fucking stormin'.

167
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:34,971
Going to give it to 'em.

168
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,609
But look, we can't do sketches
without Waldo.

169
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,569
It's a Waldo pilot,
it's a Waldo show,

170
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,169
it's got to be Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

171
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,929
Realistically, there isn't
the budget for other animations.

172
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,129
I mean live action,
other characters I can do.

173
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,009
What about the Brown Knight?

174
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,569
What, the crap crusader?

175
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,409
We can look into the Brown Knight.

176
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,131
But right now
let's find more Waldo ideas.

177
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:19,089
The problem is, any guests
we book will be in on it.

178
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,451
They know that Waldo's a joke,
the surprise is gone.

179
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:23,410
So, we think round that.

180
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,891
Hey, boys and girls!
It's Waldo time!

181
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:28,051
Yeah! Ha-ha!

182
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:31,130
He's awesome, isn't he?

183
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:34,851
I mean, look - sod name in lights,
you're an app now, my brother.

184
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:40,129
All right, Sara? How's the
think tanking going, good shit?

185
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,131
Um, yeah, yeah,
we're making headway.

186
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:43,610
Good.

187
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,929
I see our friend Monroe
is in the news again,

188
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,649
running in
the Stentonford by-election.

189
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,251
We should get Waldo down there.

190
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,287
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
actually.

191
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:56,489
We get a van with a screen with
the image of Waldo on the side.

192
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,688
Like it.

193
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,927
And then, when Monroe's
doing a meet and greet,

194
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:01,807
we just turn up
and just get under his skin.

195
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,047
I love that, I love it.

196
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:03,887
We've done Monroe.

197
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:05,266
But it was a great bit.

198
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,786
I'm not dumb or clever enough
to be political...

199
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:11,146
Why don't we get Waldo
to stand for the by-election?

200
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:13,466
- Get people to vote for him?
- He's not real.

201
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:15,946
But people have stood as
fictional characters before.

202
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:18,266
Do you think Screaming
Lord Sutch was his real name?

203
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,546
We just put "commonly known as"
on the ballot.

204
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,846
No-one's actually going to vote
for him, that's not the point.

205
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,019
The point is, we get to hang around,
we're there for the count.

206
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,701
Well, go on then, Sara,
whack it up there.

207
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,783
'He's with a mum and baby group.'

208
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:51,463
OK. Going live
in five... four... three two...

209
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:54,142
'Thank you so much
for joining me this morning.'

210
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,782
It's been incredibly informative

211
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:58,984
and I think we should have a little
round of applause for the children,

212
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:00,943
who were fantastic.

213
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:03,463
Thank you, Naomi.

214
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:05,344
Thank you for your time.

215
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:09,783
Hey!

216
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:12,343
Hey, it's me Waldo.

217
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,783
Oh. I like your trainers, man!

218
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:17,302
I'd wear trainers myself
but I can't cos I haven't got feet.

219
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,344
I've got stumps.

220
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:20,623
He's out.

221
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:22,703
Hey, Mr Monroe! Mr Monroe.

222
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:24,822
Hey! Did you get off with
any of the mums?

223
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,944
Where'd you look while
they were breastfeeding?

224
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,423
They got big milky tits, Mr Monroe!

225
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,183
He said it!

226
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:33,623
Mr Monroe, don't walk away from me!

227
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:35,542
- I'm sorry about this, Liam.
- Hey, I'm being snubbed!

228
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:38,262
Hey, don't ignore me.
Don't just get in your car.

229
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,502
It's a death trap anyway,
look at it!

230
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,544
Let's find out what we can about
the idiot inside that thing.

231
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:43,544
Sure.

232
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,544
Mr Monroe. Oi!

233
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,943
'Stentonford Labour Party.'

234
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,864
Right, you've got
a choice of styles,

235
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:59,183
so just choose one from there.
Then you put your name in there.

236
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:00,864
This is like bloody Moonpig.

237
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:03,864
Don't knock the free mail out.

238
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,904
Bet Liam Monroe doesn't use some
Fisher-Price leaflet app.

239
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,424
He doesn't have to.

240
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:19,102
Day one of the campaign
in Stentonford and Hersham,

241
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:21,942
and Tory hopeful Liam Monroe
hits the ground running.

242
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:24,822
The license fee is something
that's very close to my heart...

243
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,224
'Mr Monroe, ey! Oh, oh, oh!
Look at me Mr Monroe, please!'

244
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:29,823
Hey, over here! Hey, over here...

245
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:31,823
Look over here, Mr Monroe...

246
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,622
The Conservative Party
have been, er...

247
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:37,222
Have been arguing for a reduction
of the license fee for...

248
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:39,182
- Good morning, everybody.
- Pardon?

249
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:40,624
Why you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?
Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

250
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,863
I beg your pardon.

251
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,943
I'm sorry. It's rather loud.

252
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:45,462
We have argued for a further
reduction in the license fee...

253
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:47,382
Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

254
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:49,182
Mum with a pushchair -
drag her into it.

255
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:50,624
Hey, you. Mum with the pushchair.

256
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,623
Yeah, you. Ask Mr Monroe
why he's ignoring me.

257
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,863
Why are you ignoring Waldo?

258
00:11:56,864 --> 00:12:00,263
'Mr Monroe, what's Waldo
done to you?'

259
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:03,824
We should probably just shift
before this turns stupid.

260
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:07,144
I'm not walking away from a cartoon.

261
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:10,743
'I'm not ignoring you.'

262
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,943
Yeah, you were, you upset me.

263
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,063
You made Waldo sad.

264
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:18,584
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ah.

265
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:23,944
Well, obviously, I'm absolutely
devastated that you're upset...

266
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:26,144
WA-A-A-A-A-A-A...

267
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:31,304
Let him get a word in.

268
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:36,063
I'm not ignoring you
because there is no you.

269
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:38,903
You are an image voiced
by a comedian -

270
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:40,782
an alleged comedian,
more accurately.

271
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,902
If I'm not real,
why you talking to him?

272
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:44,864
And by "him" I mean me, knobber!

273
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,744
There's no point in attempting
to converse with a cartoon.

274
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,543
Ooh, "converse", Your Lordship!

275
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:55,944
Thy flowery language doth give
me a right throbbing bone-on!

276
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,704
Uh-ha-ha-ha-huh!

277
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:01,103
Uh-er-ha-ha!

278
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:03,223
Ha-ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-uh!

279
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:06,783
Uh-uh-uh-oh! Huh!

280
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,184
Finished.

281
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,303
Drink?

282
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:18,904
I've got e-mails.

283
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:28,503
You know that's Gwendolyn Harris?

284
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:29,784
The Labour candidate.

285
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,384
Did you read my background doc?

286
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:34,544
Yes.

287
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:38,584
Why don't you read it tonight? Alone.

288
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:51,424
I'll swing by about nine,
so have your breakfast first...

289
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:53,463
Are you my dad?

290
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:56,384
Apparently not. See you tomorrow.

291
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:01,422
'..Waldo the bear left
Monroe in stunned silence.

292
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,942
'The colourful Waldo
launched his own campaign

293
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,784
'in typically loud and
crowd-pleasing style...'

294
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:12,064
Someone's bold? Do I know you?

295
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,423
Nice way to greet a voter...

296
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:16,383
Sorry, I thought you were...

297
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:19,383
Actually, I'm more of a rival.

298
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:22,942
"Hey, Mr Monroe, Mr Monroe, why
are you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?"

299
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:24,182
You're good at that!

300
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:25,302
Because I am that.

301
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:26,424
What? You're that thing?

302
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:29,783
Waldo's not a thing, he's a bear.

303
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:34,143
Liam Monroe calls him worse.
Nice work there, by the way.

304
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:37,664
Yeah, well. It's dick jokes
at his expense basically.

305
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:38,783
Another one?

306
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:40,224
OK. One.

307
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:47,624
The way you describe it, it's like
you're doing this for a showreel...

308
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,663
No...

309
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,384
like this place is the equivalent
of a walk-on in a sketch show...

310
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:52,423
Shh!

311
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,802
But your party leader has to show
up because it's a... mid-thing...

312
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,090
Midterm by-election.

313
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,132
Terminology tits.

314
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,331
You are 12!

315
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,290
So because leaderballs is there,

316
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,330
suddenly it's walk-on
in a Ricky Gervais sketch show

317
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,690
so it's good exposure.

318
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:07,210
- You're not going to win, you know
you're not going to win...
- Come on, shh.

319
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,252
You're not going to win though.

320
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:10,291
Of course not.

321
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,490
So, why not be honest?

322
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:13,530
Say, "You arseholes aren't
going to vote for me,

323
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:14,970
"so here's what I think anyway."?

324
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:18,412
- It doesn't work like that.
- Nothing does, that's why
everything's bollocksed.

325
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:21,611
You're angry, for someone
who's doing well.

326
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:25,531
I'm the voice of a blue bear...

327
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:28,292
if that's, "doing well,"
then we are doomed!

328
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:33,491
I can't see!

329
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,012
Hang on, there's a thing.

330
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:41,892
Have you had a fox in here or do you
live like a 14-year-old?

331
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:48,532
Well, don't get too excited,
I'm not sleeping in it.

332
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:49,892
Shit, really?

333
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:07,811
You're amazing.

334
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:08,971
Sorry?

335
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,811
You're amazing?

336
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,452
Oh, thank you!

337
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:37,851
What's up?

338
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:39,411
Nothing.

339
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,732
Are you sure?

340
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:47,172
It's just...

341
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,892
I haven't been happy in a while...

342
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:58,691
and this is good, you know?

343
00:16:58,692 --> 00:16:59,732
Hm.

344
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:12,732
Can I... have your number?

345
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,172
Yes!

346
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:37,092
Where's our mark this morning?

347
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:38,611
We're out on the road.

348
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:40,732
Ooh... bien sur.

349
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:52,011
Oh, hello, I'm Mr Monroe.
Vote for me and keep things shitty.

350
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:54,092
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

351
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:22,372
Vote Waldo! Vote Waldo!

352
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:26,692
'You're right. Strong Tory.'

353
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:27,971
'I warned you.'

354
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:31,572
You know you're on Monroe turf
when they live so far apart.

355
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:35,012
I'm voting Waldo!

356
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,971
I met Waldo last night.

357
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:42,892
Jamie, the guy who plays him.

358
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:44,011
He's fun.

359
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:45,611
Fun?

360
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:46,652
Mmm-hmm.

361
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:51,212
Did you tell him anything
about our campaign?

362
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,771
Not really.

363
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:54,412
Not really or no?

364
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,172
Er, not really.

365
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,335
Look, he's OK.

366
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:00,535
He's a comedian -

367
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:02,976
he's mocking Monroe now,
it'll be you next.

368
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:07,935
His act is all f-this
and penis jokes.

369
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:09,015
But...

370
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:10,896
Don't see him again.

371
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:20,576
OK. Job done till
the husting tomorrow.

372
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:24,694
Some media students doing
a Question Time type thing.

373
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,694
They've asked Waldo
to join the panel.

374
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:29,774
Oh, come on. It's my nightmare,
going on Question Time.

375
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:31,014
It's students, you'll walk it.

376
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:32,774
I can't answer
serious questions...

377
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:36,016
No-one wants you to!
You're the comic relief, lighten up.

378
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:51,536
Erm, just have a look. I'm sure
you'll find lots in there...

379
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:59,336
Are there any particular issues that
you're concerned about at all?

380
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,055
Hey.

381
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:17,095
Oh, hi.

382
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,294
- I thought we were going to...?
- Sorry - I've had a tough day...

383
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,536
Right. Not even one?

384
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,175
Sorry.

385
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,736
Well, what about tomorrow?

386
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:27,776
- Look, I can't, when this is happening,
I can't see you.
- What do you mean?

387
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:28,896
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:43,958
Do they think that
looks like Question Time?

389
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,998
Yeah. It looks politicsy.

390
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,437
Check the host.

391
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:50,602
Jailbait Dimbleby.

392
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:02,322
When it comes to addiction
and addicts, we should sympathise,

393
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,520
but we shouldn't patronise.

394
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:07,919
You know, serious drug use is
a criminal of fence, that is

395
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,521
committed voluntarily
and for pleasure...

396
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:14,039
Look, I'm sorry, these are the
facts.

397
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,399
Waldo, what do you think?

398
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,041
Mr Monroe, are you addicted?

399
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,760
No.

400
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,681
Sorry, I mean, are you a dickhead?

401
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:24,999
I think we have to ask ourselves...

402
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,479
I think we have to ask ourselves,
what is this for?

403
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,401
And why do we waste our time with
animated trivialities like him?

404
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,240
I mean why?

405
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:36,400
Why? I mean why?

406
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:38,400
I mean why? I mean why?

407
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:39,919
I mean why? I mean why?

408
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,399
This is just the kind of thing...
rather than see you laugh...

409
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,959
They laugh at you, Limbo.

410
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,439
You laugh, you're laughing
at someone who won't engage.

411
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,761
Who is scared to engage, who
hides behind a children's cartoon.

412
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:54,560
Who you calling a kiddy toon, fool?

413
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm... I'm... I'm
speaking about James Salter.

414
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,681
Hm?

415
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:04,440
Don't worry about it.

416
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:06,520
That's your name, isn't it?

417
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:09,041
James Salter, this is the man
who's behind all this.

418
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,960
He's 33 years old,

419
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:15,799
a man whose career can be summed up
surprisingly quickly.

420
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,319
You were in a sketch troupe

421
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,719
that enjoyed minor success about
six years ago,

422
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,799
and the others moved on to
better things,

423
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,559
but your main achievement seems to
have been playing

424
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,239
the part of a corn on the cob

425
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,241
in a high-interest personal
loan commercial.

426
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,559
I notice you keep that
pretty quiet.

427
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,719
And now of course operating
this sort of teddy bear thing.

428
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,561
Which by the way is easier than it
looks. Anyone could do it.

429
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:45,040
See, this is... this is the thing.
It's easy, what he does.

430
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,560
He mocks.

431
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:49,079
And when he can't
think of an authentic joke,

432
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,881
which is actually quite often,
he just swears.

433
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:56,999
I think that this puppet's
inclusion on this panel debases the

434
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,079
process of debate, and smothers any
meaningful discussion of the issues.

435
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,679
So I return to my original question,
is that really what this is for?

436
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,761
He has nothing to offer
and he has nothing to say.

437
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,560
Prove me wrong. Hm?

438
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,640
Speak, Waldo.

439
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:17,841
Please. Come on. Speak up.

440
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,280
There you see, nothing.

441
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:24,521
Oh, go fuck yourself.

442
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,400
It's more swearing.

443
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:29,680
You're a joke.

444
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:30,959
You look less human than I do

445
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,121
and I'm a made-up bear with
a turquoise cock.

446
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:40,440
What are you? You're just an old
attitude with new hair.

447
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:43,359
Assuming you're my superior because
I'm not taking you seriously?

448
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,719
No-one takes you seriously,
that's why no-one votes.

449
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,039
The vast majority do vote.

450
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,879
It's bullshit.

451
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,199
Surely this is enough?

452
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,799
You think you deserve respect.

453
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,879
Just common courtesy.

454
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,359
Because you went to public school

455
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,519
and believed you were
entitled to everything.

456
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,639
- Perhaps we could get back...
- Ad hominem nonsense...

457
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,719
Gwendolyn Harris...

458
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,839
Something's got to change. No-one
trusts you lot cos they know

459
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,519
you don't give a shit about anything
outside your bubble.

460
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,239
What about your mate Gladwell,
the kiddy-flasher?

461
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,039
You knew him for 20 years,
did you not know what he was like?

462
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,121
No, of course not.

463
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:15,520
Yeah, cos you're all just front,
like him, sly and pretending,

464
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,521
and in that way you're all the same.

465
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:22,320
Gwendolyn Harris,
is all of politics a waste of time?

466
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:24,800
Well, of course I think no...

467
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:27,760
Oh, shut up, you're worse!

468
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:29,639
Seriously, she's faker than him.

469
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,719
- For once I agree with Liam Monroe
in that this...
- Are you going to win?

470
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,919
Doesn't get us anywhere and
there's no point in us continuing...

471
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,399
Tell them why you're here.

472
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,921
If we can't have anything
resembling a deba...

473
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:40,961
Tell them why you're here.

474
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:46,240
She's here to build a showreel.

475
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,799
I'm not kidding, that's literally
it.

476
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,041
Knows she's not going to win.
This is all experience,

477
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:52,320
to get on telly.

478
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,919
She actually gives less of a shit
about anyone round here than

479
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,321
he does, because he'll actually
have to represent you.

480
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:58,520
Am I wrong?

481
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:02,520
A career politician.
Someone else less real than me,

482
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:03,801
and I can do this.

483
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,881
Can I just make
a couple of points?

484
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:11,600
Oh, shut up, you pebble.

485
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:14,319
What is this for? That's what you
wanted to know, Mr Monroe.

486
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,321
And the truth is, none of us
know any more, thanks to you.

487
00:25:17,322 --> 00:25:20,520
What are you for? What are you for?

488
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,321
Thank you and goodnight.

489
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:15,041
Jamie.

490
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,001
Jamie?

491
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:21,961
Jack's here. He wants to see us.

492
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:24,441
You can't avoid it.

493
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:33,081
Get dressed, he'll meet us outside.

494
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,641
'And yet accusations of vapidity
aside,

495
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,960
'it's clearly tapped a nerve.

496

viral.

497

'The video of his clash has already
been viewed over a million times

498
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,961
'on YouTube. There are Facebook
groups calling on Waldo

499
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:04,760
'to form a national party.'

500
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:06,480
'You're a joke.

I'm not taking you seriously.

'No-one takes you (BLEEP)
seriously.'

506
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:31,559
Oh, look, here
he is the man of the moment!

507
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,281
How does it feel to be a phenomenon?

508
00:27:33,282 --> 00:27:34,281
Shitifying.

509
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:37,399
You are everywhere, my son.

510
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,521
Twitter, the news...
Have you seen the poll?

511
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:41,720
You're in third place, mate.

512
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:43,359
You overtook that Lib Dem prick...

513
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,001
- Yeah, well, he's a glass of water.
- This is an opportunity, Jamie.

514
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:48,040
He knows my name now.

515
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,839
We could really do something here.

516
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,199
You know, everyone's pissed
with the status quo.

517
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,041
And Waldo gives that a voice.

518
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:56,800
Waldo's a bear. A blue bear.

519
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,400
Tell him, Tams.

520
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:00,640
We've been asked on Consensus.

521
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:04,041
It's a ten-minute one-to-one
interview with Phillip Crane.

522
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,160
Pitbull Crane?

523
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:06,239
Big guns for big guns.

524
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,519
Hello? I'm not a politician, OK?
I don't want to be a politician.

525
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,879
We know that you hate politics.

526
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,439
I don't hate them,
I'm just not interested in them.

527
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,159
You don't need to be
interested in them.

528
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,481
You just need to be Waldo.

529
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:21,401
And when Crane asks something tricky and I look
stupid because I don't know how to answer?

530
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:23,480
You'll know the answer.

531
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:25,241
Because you have a producer.

532
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:28,720
Look, I can tell you what to say.

533
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:31,639
I can live Google any facts,
give you stats, quotes,

534
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,679
whatever else you need.

535
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,919
So you've got a safety
net for the concrete stuff

536
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,481
and the rest is Waldo
and you can do that in your sleep.

537
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,520
You'll piss all over Crane.

538
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,599
He'll know there's a team around me,
he'll see it.

539
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,199
Yeah good. I hope he does.
I hope he points a camera at it.

540
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,281
All the other MPs have got teams,
we're just more honest about it.

541
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:49,721
Now come on. What d'you say? Eh?

542
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:54,181
Jamie! Jamie!

543
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:55,420
Why would I want to do this?

544
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:58,460
Look, the world is knackered
and you can do something about it.

545
00:28:58,461 --> 00:28:59,940
I don't know what you're on about.

546
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:02,860
Waldo has got the attention
of the young, and the young don't

547
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:05,860
give a shit about anything
except trainers and pirating films.

548
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:08,620
Do you have any other astounding
theories about young people?

549
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:12,220
Yeah, yeah I do actually.
Look, they care about Waldo.

550
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:13,580
They'll vote for Waldo.

551
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,060
The video was a hit for a reason.

552
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,380
The video's embarrassing.
I'm embarrassed by it.

553
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,300
I was lashing out.
I wasn't even articulate -

554
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,500
Doesn't matter.
Or funny, which is almost worse.

555
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:22,780
We can build on that.

556
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:23,860
Waldo's not real.

557
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:27,660
Exactly! That's what you said that
really hit home. He's not real,

558
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:29,220
but he's realer than all the others.

559
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:30,900
He doesn't stand for anything.

560
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,342
Yeah, well, at least
he doesn't pretend to.

561
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,861
Look we... we don't need politicians,

562
00:29:35,862 --> 00:29:38,700
we've all got iPhones
and computers, right?

563
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:42,260
So any decision that has to be made,
any policy, we just put it online.

564
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:46,020
Let the people vote thumbs up,
thumbs down, the majority wins.

565
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:48,900
That's a democracy. That's a...
that's an actual democracy.

566
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:51,900
So's YouTube and I don't know
if you've seen it but the most

567
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:55,942
popular video is a dog farting
the theme tune to Happy Days.

568
00:29:58,022 --> 00:29:59,861
Well, today it's Waldo.

569
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:02,541
No. It's still the dog.

570
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:05,180
Listen, can you imagine all
the things we can change

571
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:07,220
if we fuck the politicians
out the equation?

572
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:09,742
I've said what I've said
and now I'm shutting this door.

573
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:17,781
Do you know who owns Waldo?

574
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:18,982
I do, I own the rights.

575
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,821
He's my character.

576
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,462
Yeah, written for my show.

577
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:30,221
You're too frightened to take to
the next level. Fine. I understand.

578
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,101
But also, fuck off!

579
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:33,062
And watch me fly.

580
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,502
You own Waldo, you can't be Waldo.

581
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:41,742
Eh, Jamie, Jamie,
Jamie, what's 'appenin, eh?

582
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:45,182
Pretty close, I'd say.

583
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:53,051
What's happenin'? Ahh!

584
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:56,777
Waldorific, yeah! Yeah!

585
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:58,136
Why is it going off left again?

586
00:30:58,137 --> 00:30:58,856
Because the...

587
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,218
- I know! I've got my...
- Put your thumb in the white thing.

588
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:03,137
I got that. In there? OK.

589
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:04,818
That's not how that works.

590
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:18,137
First tonight, a figure -
or more accurately a character -

591
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:21,776
who's been causing an upset
in the Stentonford by-election.

592
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:25,136
Unlike the other candidates,
he has no party affiliation.

593
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,016
He doesn't even have a surname.

594
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:31,418
He is Waldo, a few weeks ago just
a cult character in a comedy show.

595
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:35,057
Today, an official
mascot for protest voters.

596
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:36,217
Vote Waldo.

597
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:39,576
Cartoons don't play by the rules
and Waldo's open disdain

598
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:42,378
for his opponents
has clearly struck a chord.

599
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:47,696
Waldo, as a mascot
for the disenfranchised, aren't you

600
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,938
ultimately neutralizing seriously
effective dissent?

601
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:54,056
Can I have subtitles for Mr Crane,
please?

602
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:57,496
By encouraging people not to care,
you're actively dangerous.

603
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:59,498
Dangerous? You think
the public can't be trusted?

604
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:00,577
No.

605
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:02,058
Isn't that basically you
calling them twats?

606
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:03,057
No, I...

607
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:04,137
Bell-ends then?

608
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:05,736
Did you come for a discussion
or...

609
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,936
You're snooty for a glorified
Punch And Judy man, Phil.

610
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:11,776
You know you're gonna get your best
ratings in months cos I'm here.

611
00:32:11,777 --> 00:32:14,576
To even get close to the figures
I'm gonna pull in for you tonight,

612
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:17,416
you'd have to fuck a prawn sandwich
live on air.

613
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:19,056
Make a nice prawn cocktail.

614
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:21,216
Could we make a serious
political point that is...

615
00:32:21,217 --> 00:32:23,136
I've got one big blue point
to make, fool.

616
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,016
- Would you like to have a look at it?
- Oh, God. Thank you.

617
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:27,776
Great work tonight. Look at... Look
at this, look at this.

618
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:30,936
It's The Waldo polling app.
Now, this can pinpoint you with GPS

619
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:32,776
so that when you're at a polling
station,

620
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:34,338
it unlocks loads of free shit, look.

621
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:38,337
Thanks for voting, dickhead!

622
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:39,496
It's good, isn't it?

623
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:40,936
Who's this guy we're meeting?

624
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:44,858
I dunno. But he's from Washington
and he's got my restricted number.

625
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,937
Jeff Carter, from the agency.

626
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:51,577
Hey. Hey.

627
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:52,856
And I'll leap right in.

628
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:55,458
I think what you're doing
with Waldo is fascinating.

629
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:56,777
From "the agency"?

630
00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:00,458
Yeah, listen. Waldo may be
the perfect political figurehead.

631
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:01,937
Waldo The Bear.

632
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,976
The bear, people like.
The fact he's a bear is an assist.

633
00:33:04,977 --> 00:33:06,496
- An assist?
- It helps.

634
00:33:06,497 --> 00:33:08,736
Right. You look at human
politicians,

635
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,576
you're instinctively like,
"brrrr" - uncanny, right?

636
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:12,776
Like the girls in porn.

637
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:15,296
You know something's wrong,
cos why else are they doing it?

638
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:16,976
It's usually daddy issues, eh?

639
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:19,296
Just like politics.
Waldo bypasses that.

640
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,778
You already know he's not real,
so no personal flaws.

641
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,257
I'm a person.

642
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:25,136
With respect, Waldo's more than you.

643
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:28,778
He's a team, and you're open
about that, which is fantastic.

644
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:30,737
The honesty thing works.

645
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:35,017
Waldo is a construct
people not just accept but embrace.

646
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:36,938
At the moment he's anti-politics,

647
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:40,017
which is a political stance itself,
right?

648
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,936
But he could deliver any brand
of political content,

649
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,816
minus the potential downsides
of a human messenger.

650
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:49,696
In a debate, your team could Google
every word the other guy says,

651
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:51,696
then let Waldo hit him
with debunk stats

652
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,898
and spit a Twitter-ready
zinger into the next sentence.

653
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,217
He's the perfect assassin.

654
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:58,938
We won't win, though.

655
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:04,657
You guys are so British.

656
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:08,776
No, of course he won't win. You
started out too coarse off the bat.

657
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:11,978
There's no substantial basis
to what you offer, and the whole

658
00:34:11,979 --> 00:34:16,377
nihilist "democracy sucks" thing,
yeah, is kind of wack-a-doo,

659
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:20,857
but with a targeted, hopeful
message, which we can provide,

660
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:24,056
energising the disenfranchised
without spooking the middle

661
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:28,538
via your new platform... You got
a global political-entertainment

662
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:31,058
product people actually want.

663
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:34,418
You could roll this out worldwide.

664
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,337
Like Pringles.

665
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:37,738
Absolutely.

666
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:46,177
It's, er... It's interesting stuff
though.

667
00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:47,976
When you're done with Stentonford,

668
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:50,578
there may be an opportunity
in South America.

669
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,217
Se puede hablar espanol?

670
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:54,657
Vivi en Madrid tres anos.

671
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:56,498
Excelente.

672
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,578
What?

673
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:19,537
He's not coming.

674
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:22,137
But he's the party leader!

675
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:23,258
It's too toxic.

676
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,256
Meanwhile,
as support for Gwendolyn Harris

677
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,536
appears to be dwindling,

678
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:34,416
Labour denies the party is losing
faith in their young candidate.

679
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:37,098
But Miss Harris spent most of
the day locked in crisis talks

680
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,338
at party headqu...

681
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:46,298
In the Stentonford by-election,
Waldo the cartoon bear continues...

682
00:35:47,538 --> 00:35:50,016
Did you see Gwendolyn Harris
yesterday?

683
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,098
She looks like she's been poisoned.

684
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,497
Because he's gonna overtake her.

685
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:55,896
We're still way ahead.

686
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:59,218
If that thing is the main opposition
then the whole system looks absurd.

687
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:04,377
Which it may well be.

688
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:05,898
But it built these roads.

689
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:15,858
Just come in, Roy.

690
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,858
I'm sorry, OK?

691
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:27,776
It was wrong to speak to you
like that and...

692
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:30,218
After the campaign,
I would've called you.

693
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:33,337
After the campaign!

694
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,498
All you've done
is strengthen Monroe.

695
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:40,456
You won't win either, but I was
at least attempting to represent...

696
00:36:40,457 --> 00:36:43,416
Well I don't know!
Not just "bollocks to everything".

697
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,096
If you were preaching revolution,
well that'd be something,

698
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:49,178
but you're not because that would
require courage and a mindset.

699
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:51,818
And what have you got?

700
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,578
Who are you?

701
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:57,618
What are you for?

702
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:05,858
Morning.

703
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:17,657
So, final push.

704
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:19,296
You remind everyone
that's got the app

705
00:37:19,297 --> 00:37:23,098
that if they recommend it to a friend
it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.

706
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,178
We're here.

707
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:29,377
Attention, shoppers.

708
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:32,778
I'm here to ask you an important
favour. Gather round.

709
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:34,938
Come over here and listen.

710
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,577
Don't vote for me. I'm an insult.

711
00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:41,977
Seriously.

712
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:45,137
Vote for Monroe or Harris
or, I dunno, UKIP,

713
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,017
or even that Lib Dem guy.

714
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:48,617
He's a prick!

715
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:52,296
Seriously, only an arsehole
would actually vote for me.

716
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:53,456
What is this? Irony?

717
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:55,176
I'm worse than a wasted vote.

718
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:56,896
He's from the Harris campaign.

719
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:59,176
I mean it, you idiots!
Don't vote for me!

720
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,378
Don't vote for me!
Don't vote for me!

721
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,297
Don't vote for me!

722
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:04,978
Don't vmmmf!

723
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:08,497
Shut up.

724
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:10,456
No. Don't boo him,
he's right! He's right!

725
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:11,618
What are you doing?

726
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:13,138
- Resigning.
- Jamie!

727
00:38:14,738 --> 00:38:16,537
Look! It's me, I'm Waldo.

728
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:19,697
This guy, whoever this guy is,
he's a hero.

729
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:22,096
You should throw stuff at Waldo,
he's bad bloody news.

730
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:23,456
- He's funny!
- He's not.

731
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:26,016
Don't listen to that man,
he's a lesbian. Ahh!

732
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:29,616
So remember, the polls are open,
and if you've got my app, you can

733
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:32,978
unlock new stuff like catchphrases
and a little hat 'n' that.

734
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:37,377
Only an idiot wouldn't vote for me
so question the status quo!

735
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:38,617
Kill it! Kill it!

736
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,497
Kick them where it hurts.

737
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:43,176
The first man to hit him
gets 500 quid!

738
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:46,618
Yeah, that's right. Knock him down.
Knock him down.

739
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,057
Smash it!

740
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:50,217
Yeah! Yeah!

741
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:54,578
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah...

742
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:05,136
I, the undersigned,

743
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,256
being the returning
officer for the Stentonford

744
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:10,936
and Hersham constituency, hereby
give notice that the total number

745
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:14,378
of votes recorded for each candidate
at the election is as follows.

746
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:19,377
Finch, Simon Arthur.
Liberal Democrats.

747
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:21,538
2,449.

748
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:28,137
Harris, Gwendolyn Jodie. Labour.

749
00:39:28,138 --> 00:39:30,418
11,237.

750
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:38,297
Monroe, Liam George Tennyson.
Conservative.

751
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:40,738
19,161.

752
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,498
Waldo, Independent.

753
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:55,458
16,784.

754
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:03,256
Ladies... Ladies and gentlemen,
please! I declare that Liam Monroe

755
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:06,178
is duly elected member of Parliament
for the constituency.

756
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:10,817
Hey, hey! Everyone!

757
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:13,298
500 quid to anyone
who can lob a shoe!

758
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:46,017
Up you get, come on.

759
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:47,298
Come on!

760
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:57,858
Come on. Out you go.

761
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:55,618
Oi!

762
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,218
Agh!

763
00:42:25,746 --> 00:43:09,867
