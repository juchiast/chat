1
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,680
Open one of those for us.

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,920
You know you're the only one
who can stand these things?

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,440
They're the only things left.

4
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,640
The pigs have all gone.

5
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,400
Used to be full of pigs, that.

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Yeah, that and pig shit.

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
- Dogs took care of them.
- Don't think I could hack being a pig.

8
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,960
- I don't think you could either.
- What's so bad about being a pig?

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
It's undignified.

10
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
Undignified?

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,480
Walking about with your nose
the same height as your asshole.

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,880
- Snout.
- What's that?

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Pigs have snouts, not noses.

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,721
So it would be your snout the
same height as your asshole.

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,920
Nose, snout.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,275
You're still trotting about gazing up

17
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:44,480
everybody else's assholes all day long.

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
What kind of society is that?

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,320
An equal one?

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
So what do you reckon?

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,480
Yes or no?

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,240
I can give it a go.
You're not gonna be long?

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,080
Five minutes, max.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh, fucking hell.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,360
This is mental, this is.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
I mean, he's dying anyway.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
Well, he is.

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
I mean, it's not like
it's gonna save him.

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,560
He's got, what, days?

30
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,080
Well, if it's what's in there
makes those days easier...

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
that'll do for me.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,680
I promised my sister we'd help him.

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,200
We all promised her.

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840
Plus there'll be other
stuff in there. Batteries.

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,280
- All sorts.
- OK. OK.

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,440
- Leave the keys in the ignition.
- I'm ahead of you there.

37
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,770
If you hear anything, yeah,
don't fuck about, yeah?

38
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,881
Just tear straight off.

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,840
- Five minutes?
- No more.

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
All right?

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,400
You sure it's gonna be in there?

42
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720
Course I'm not sure.

43
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,280
Fuck it.

44
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,360
Oh, fuck.

45
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,520
95-DY42.

46
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,280
95-DY42.

47
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,280
95-DY42.

48
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
95-DY42.

49
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,240
95-DY42.

50
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,920
95-DY...

51
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,440
95-DY42.

52
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
Psst.

53
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
Quick.

54
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,040
Shh!

55
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Oh, fuck.

56
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,040
Go. Go.

57
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,360
Go! Go!

58
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,920
Tony!

59
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,320
Clarke! Go!

60
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,440
Oh, fuck.

61
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,760
Come on.

62
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,800
Come on. Yes.

63
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,520
No!

64
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Oh, fucking hell.

65
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
No, please!

66
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,680
Please, no! Fuck, no! No, please!

67
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,000
Please!

68
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Fuck!

69
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,360
Fuck!

70
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,270
Fuck!

71
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Fucker!

72
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,840
Fuck!

73
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,520
Fuck!

74
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,920
Ah!

75
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,440
Fuck!

76
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,440
Fuck. Fuck you, you... Fuck!

77
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
Ah.

78
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
OK.

79
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,000
Shit.

80
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
Oh.

81
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,400
Ahh.

82
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,640
Ah.

83
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
OK.

84
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,840
Oh.

85
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Ah!

86
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,000
Ah!

87
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,920
Gah!

88
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,160
Ah!

89
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,440
Anyone?

90
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,120
Come in?

91
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,640
If you can hear me, it's Bella.

92
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,720
Hello?

93
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
Oh.

94
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,600
Pick up. Please, fucking pick up.

95
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh, fuck.

96
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Hello? Who is that?

97
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,600
I can't hear you. You're not clear.

98
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,720
Listen, if you can hear me,
just whistle. Don't say anything.

99
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,840
OK, OK.

100
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I can't talk for long.

101
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,200
We found a dog at the warehouse.

102
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,160
We didn't see it. We don't know
how long it had been in there.

103
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,480
It got Tony and Clarke.

104
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,080
So they're gone. I'm... I'm sorry.

105
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,160
And can you tell Ali that I'm sorry too?

106
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,280
She said that we were mad
to bother and she was right.

107
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,040
We... We just wanted
to help her with Jack.

108
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,920
I don't know...

109
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,240
Get him something that might help.

110
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,480
I know he's in pain.

111
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,080
I've lost the dog for now, but my
guess is it's still operational.

112
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,640
And I'm figuring it can
lock onto this signal,

113
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:29,320
so I'm gonna have to go dark.

114
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,480
It's, um... It stuck me with a
tracker, but I managed to get it out.

115
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,880
I'm gonna have to find somewhere
overnight to hide out, I...

116
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
Get some medical stuff or something.

117
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,200
If I don't make it back...

118
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,240
will you pass a message to Graham?

119
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,960
Just I love him.

120
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,760
Please would you pass that on?

121
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,920
I'm gonna have to switch off
now. I'll try and make it back.

122
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,400
Bye, now.

123
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Oh, fuck.

124
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,760
Fuck!

125
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,280
Ah!

126
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Come on.

127
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,520
Argh!

128
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,600
Stay still.

129
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,920
Shit, shit, shit.

130
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,800
You can't do it.

131
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,360
You can't do it.

132
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,400
Your arm's fucked, so
you can't climb the tree.

133
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,640
Yeah, take a good look, mate.

134
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,400
You'll be waiting a long time.

135
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,280
A very long time.

136
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Oh.

137
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Oh!

138
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,520
Oh, God.

139
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,400
Ahh!

140
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,600
Oh.

141
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,760
Welcome back.

142
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
1,000...

143
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,960
999,

144
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,160
998,

145
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,920
997,

146
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,960
996...

147
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,720
... nine, eight, seven,

148
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,080
six, five, four,

149
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,720
three, two, one.

150
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,000
1,000...

151
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,240
999...

152
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,800
four...

153
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,280
three...

154
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,960
two...

155
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
one.

156
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,880
Ah.

157
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
1,000...

158
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
999...

159
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,840
998...

160
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,920
... three, two, one.

161
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,080
993, 992...

162
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,760
Yes.

163
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,720
... four, three,

164
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,120
two, one.

165
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,640
Oh, fuck.

166
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,040
Ah, fuck!

167
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,760
Ah.

168
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,440
Ah!

169
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,560
Oh.

170
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,360
Ah, come on.

171
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,720
Oh, come on.

172
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,080
Oh, shit.

173
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,480

Say I'm sorry to Ali and that she
should give Jack a kiss from me.

I'm sorry I didn't get the
replacement like I promised.

219
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,280
I know how dear it was to him.

220
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,200
And I did try.

221
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,080
We all tried.

222
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,680
I hope you can look after him.

00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,880
And, Graham, I love you.

224
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,920
And all of you.

225
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,040
I've always loved you all.
