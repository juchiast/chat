2
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,962
How are the pressures and saturation?

3
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:31,922
Pressures are good.
Oxygen saturation is 100%.

4
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:36,956
- Feel anything?
- No.

5
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:41,712
- How about now?
- Mnh-mnh.

6
00:00:41,714 --> 00:00:43,089
And when he does that?

7
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,696
Nothing.

8
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:48,879
OK. All set, then.

9
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,922
Making initial
incision. Hand me the Bovie.

10
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:54,962
We've entered the peritoneum.

11
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,714
I can't believe I couldn't do it.

12
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,920
I couldn't push anymore.

13
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:02,462
Don't be
ridiculous. Don't apologize.

14
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,473
We've moved the bladder.
Here's the uterine incision.

15
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:09,518
- Oh, God...
- Hey, it's gonna be fine.

16
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:12,339
I won't tell anybody if
you want to hold my hand.

17
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,545
OK, we're ready
now. How are the vitals?

18
00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:18,587
Still good. You're
gonna feel a little pressure now.

19
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:21,212
- Uh-huh.
- Occiput is visible

20
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,295
and... baby is out.

21
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:26,881
Cutting the umbilical cord.

22
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:33,464
Is she OK?

23
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:35,587
What is it?

24
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:36,754
What's...

25
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:44,420
- Say she's OK.
- Hey, hey, hey. It's OK.

26
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:46,381
Oh, God! Oh, God...

27
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:51,045
- Is she OK?
- Just relax. Hold on. OK?

28
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:53,379
Good job.

29
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:54,756
She's great.

30
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,547
Oh, she's beautiful.

31
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:20,962
One, two, three and open your
mouth and eat this down, OK?

32
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:22,672
One, two, three, boo.

33
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,258
No, no. Big "ah" and in it goes.

34
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:28,670
So, that's how it's
gonna be, huh, soldier?

35
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:30,462
I'm not a soldier.

36
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:32,462
You want me to take over?

37
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:34,463
I think your mother should know by now

38
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,462
that your grandfather's not a quitter.

39
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:39,212
One, two, three, and...

40
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:41,672
I want to take Sara to
the park. You want to come?

41
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,756
No, I'm gonna pass if you don't mind.

42
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,795
I'd like to get at that
painting, get it finished.

43
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:50,547
- Mm, the horse?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,547
Yep. Have a good time.

45
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,883
Oh! No, no.

46
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:03,006
Mommy.

47
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,212
Here we are!

48
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:32,754
Marie?

49
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:35,712
Hi!

50
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,004
I thought it was you.

51
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,712
This is Mikey.

52
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:40,504
- Hello, little guy.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:41,756
Hey, there.

54
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,379
- How old is he?
- He's seven months.

55
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,712
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Yeah. Thank you.

56
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:48,670
Kitty!

57
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:50,381
- I'm so tired.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,337
Hopefully he'll sleep through
the night one of these days.

59
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,879
Yeah, well, you're past
that. How old's Sara now?

60
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:07,164
Sara is three and she's... Sara!

61
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,554
Sara!

62
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:12,089
Come say hi to this little boy.

63
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,131
Sara?

64
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:24,506
Sara?

65
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:28,133
- Sara!
- Sara!

66
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:32,047
- Sara!
- Sara!

67
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,129
Sara!

68
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:40,172
- Mommy's looking for you!
- Sara!

69
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:46,513
Sara!

70
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:49,254
- Hey, it's OK. We're gonna find her.
- Stop!

71
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,379
- Hey, hey, lady!
- Sara!

72
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,555
I found her!

73
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,837
She was down by the
track. Fallen down the slope.

74
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,089
Said she... she followed a cat?

75
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:05,337
- She followed a cat.
- I'm so sorry.

76
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,964
I'm so sorry. I'm so
sorry. I'm right here.

77
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:11,881
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

78
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,045
- Miss Sambrell?
- Yes.

79
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,837
And Sara, right? Follow me.

80
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,965
You have a recommendation, so Sara
will be part of our trial period.

81
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:32,216
- Well, it's been tested though, right?
- Of course.

82
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,019
I mean, she's not, like, a guinea pig.

83
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:36,004
It's all fully tested, perfectly safe.

84
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,418
This is just us fine-tuning our

85
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,424
subscription model
before the full launch.

86
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:42,212
Look at the kids.

87
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:43,963
We're getting feedback on which features

88
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,754
our customers use most
in the real world.

89
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:48,837
- Uh-huh.
- Do you wanna go up? Yeah!

90
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,712
Response so far is just incredible.
The sense of security, peace of mind.

91
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:56,670
I mean, the stories we've been
hearing, they're inspirational.

92
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,920
Can you see the screen?

93
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,504
- OK, then.
- There you go.

94
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:02,295
- You like cartoons?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,920
Yeah? Shimmer and Shine?

96
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:07,464
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

97
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:11,045
Then you watch that and
I won't be a moment. OK?

98
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:37,506
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm. That's it.

99
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:42,172
So...

100
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,256
Let's get you all set up.

101
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:49,504
- I'll run you through everything. OK?
- OK.

102
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:51,881
- Feel free to ask any questions.
- Mm-hmm.

103
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,837
This is your parental hub.

104
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,006
I'm just pairing it with Sara's implant.

105
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:01,837
OK. We're all set.

106
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,379
So, this is Sara's current location,

107
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:06,879
which is here, of course.

108
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:08,545
Oh, look at that.

109
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:12,131
Now, if she ever goes missing,
all you have to do is tap here,

110
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:16,962
enter your PIN, and law enforcement
is automatically notified.

111
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:18,587
Wow, OK.

112
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:20,672
These are her vitals.

113
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,174
Healthy heartbeat. Oh, I see
her iron levels are a little low.

114
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,458
How is she eating?

115
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:30,484
Man, she's picky.
Um, she hates greens, so...

116
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,820
You might want to think
about nutritional supplements.

117
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,170
OK.

118
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:38,045
Now, tap this icon here...

119
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,087
- Mm-hmm.
- To relay her optic feed.

120
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,254
This is what she's seeing now?

121
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:45,101
That's right.

122
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:47,062
Whoa.

123
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,129
That's amazing.

124
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:52,587
Mommy! It's funny.

125
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:55,545
And there are parental
controls you can apply to that.

126
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,129
- Uh, controls?
- Content limitations.

127
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,658
If she witnesses something that causes

128
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:03,379
her cortisol levels to rise, like stress,

129
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:07,337
it can kind of paint out
whatever's triggering it.

130
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,047
- Let me show you.
- OK.

131
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,464
- Ooh.
- It's OK. Look.

132
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:19,337
See, the imagery causes a
cortisol spike, and this...

133
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,464
Filter on.

134
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,592
is what she sees and hears.

135
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,404
Whoa. OK.

136
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,587
Yeah, I'm not sure that we'll...

137
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,339
It's all optional.

138
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:33,506
OK.

139
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:35,881
How much?

140
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:39,670
Nothing. It's a free trial.

141
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:41,629
Oh, free.

142
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,381
And it's completely safe.

144
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,256
I'm sure it is, honey.

145
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:51,087
I am 2,000 years old...

146
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,994
and I remember when we used to open

147
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,004
up the door and just let the kids be.

148
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:59,798
Mm. And I remember breaking my arm
because you wouldn't get a baby gate.

149
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,089
And how is the arm now?

150
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:07,047
Feels OK.

151
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:13,256
Are you there? Mommy!

152
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,297
Where are you?

153
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:19,839
Mommy?

154
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:22,047
Are you here?

155
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:26,881
Mommy?

156
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:35,212
- Oh, what's up, sweetheart?
- I'm looking for Mommy.

157
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:39,504
You're looking for Mommy? I
got no idea where she's at.

158
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:43,087
Upstairs. Go on. Go look upstairs.

159
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,004
Mommy, where
are you? - Yoo-hoo!

160
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,381
Mommy, I hear you.

161
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:59,795
I'm gonna find you.

162
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:03,920
I hear you, Mommy.

163
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:06,629
Ah!

164
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,712
Filter on.

165
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,504
You guys gonna be all right?

166
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:05,587
I raised you all right.
You turned out OK.

167
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,464
Took you a while, but you did.

168
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,837
All right, sweetheart.
I'll see you later.

169
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,297
Terrorize your grandpa.
He can handle it.

170
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:16,172
Bye.

171
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,093
Bye.

172
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:20,089
Orange straw.

173
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,795
- OK, just push on my hand. OK.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:28,045
Relax.

175
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,170
Again. Is that all you got?

176
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:32,920
I think the range is getting better.

177
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:35,462
So how long till I can get back
on the bike again, you think?

178
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:38,754
I'd say two weeks
and maybe don't drive so fast.

179
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:39,797
Yeah, right.

180
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:43,545
OK. So, same time next week?

181
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:46,795
Uh, no, actually it's got to
be Thursday. I got plans Monday.

182
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:48,212
Something exciting?

183
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:52,131
Girlfriend's folks are in town, so nope.

184
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:58,464
Oh, well, uh, Thursday it is.

185
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:05,754
Oh, I'm liking yours. That's the way.

186
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:07,613
You're not shy about using color, are

187
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:09,424
you? That's the way a real artist...

188
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,670
I'm gonna try this...

189
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,256
Sorry, honey. Just, uh...

190
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,714
Grandpa's gotta sit...

191
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,922
Ah!

192
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:33,297
Grandpa?

193
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,712
Huh? Sara...

194
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:00,172
Sara...

195
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,381
Oh, my God!

196
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,629
OK, very good.

197
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,300
The nurse left your thing on.

198
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:16,004
Yeah, she probably forgot to take it off.

199
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:19,462
- I'll get it.
- I can get it.

200
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,045
- You good?
- Quit bugging me. Jeez.

201
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:24,297
There you go.

202
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:27,006
It's warm in here.

203
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,047
I don't need that.

204
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:40,214
Give me that.

205
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:47,256
Hey, Sara! One cookie.

206
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,297
Bad for your teeth.

207
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:58,339
Thanks.

208
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,214
What color for the hair?

209
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:57,006
Mom?

210
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,422
Uh, whatever you want.

211
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:02,256
But I'd say brunette.

212
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,879
He's got his arms
in the air. He's given up.

213
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:29,212
He's got a stick out and...

214
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:33,462
- He just, like, pounds on him.
- Turn it off, Trick. It's gross.

215
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:35,004
What is it?

216
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:37,789
Great. The walking snitch.

217
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,542
- She never snitches.
- She's just weird.

218
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:44,920
- I want to know what you're watching.
- What do you care, chip-head?

219
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:48,045
It's parental advisory.
You're locked out.

220
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,159
I want to know.

221
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:53,873
You're better off not
seeing it. Wish I never did.

222
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:56,263
What if I tell you
what's in it? That work?

223
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:02,224
So, he brings it down, like,
wham! There's all this blood.

224
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:04,919
You seen much blood?

225
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,857
It's like juice. Thick, red juice.

226
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,170
Then the guy on the ground
is all, like, "Hell, no!"

227
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:12,089
And he keeps...

228
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:22,570
Oh, it's too much. I'm
fine to have my face on the flier,

229
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:25,004
but on the poster,
it's like, "Look at me."

230
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:33,379
Sara, what are you doing?

231
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,067
Sara!

232
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:41,922
What's happening in this picture?

233
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,422
Are they happy or...

234
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:48,714
They're talking.

235
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:50,881
Just talking?

236
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:53,709
I don't know what about.

237
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:56,912
OK. Next one.

238
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:00,210
- How about that one?
- I don't know.

239
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:01,922
Is she happy?

240
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:08,254
So is this,
like, an autism thing?

241
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:12,504
The spectrum is wide, but in
my opinion, she's not on it.

242
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:15,212
But what about the
pencils, like, self-harm?

243
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:17,295
And these pictures are...

244
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,714
Has Sara ever shown any
undue anger before now?

245
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:23,462
No.

246
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:26,099
Well, then consider this part experiment,

247
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:28,295
part acting out, for your benefit.

248
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:33,170
The Arkangel never launched
nationwide. It was banned in Europe.

249
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:35,297
It'll be pulled here, too, by the fall.

250
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:38,256
I did this to her.

251
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:44,672
You can't remove the implant, but
you can get rid of the parental unit.

252
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,712
The screen.

253
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:49,589
Just throw it away. Problem solved.

254
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:57,565
Filter off.

255
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,339
Goodbye.

256
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:09,212
You're gonna be on your own today. OK?

257
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,464
No Arkangel.

258
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:15,170
The system isn't gonna be on.

259
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,146
OK? So, no fuzzy pictures.

260
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:20,837
And you won't see me?

261
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,106
I won't see you.

262
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:26,693
But, you do not have to be
afraid. I'm right down the street.

263
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:32,615
- You won't know if something happens?
- Nothing is gonna happen.

264
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:35,312
It's important that we do this.

265
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,131
You're gonna be fine.

266
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:49,589
Be good, sweetie.

267
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,254
Watch out!

268
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:23,381
Watch it, kid.

269
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,714
Come on, come on, come on.

270
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,629
OK! OK, this is enough!

271
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,766
Don't touch my stuff again, Trick.

272
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,383
Yeah? I'll do what I want.

273
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,714
What do you want?

274
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:34,006
Are you OK?

275
00:21:35,714 --> 00:21:37,089
Yeah, sure.

276
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,444
My dad's gonna see this and then bust it

277
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:43,508
all over again, 'cause I got in trouble.

278
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:51,131
Ever seen a bust lip before?

279
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:55,629
Mm... Not till now.

280
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,547
She turned the system off.

281
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:00,379
OK...

282
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:03,170
This is porn. Like, people doing it.

283
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:06,420
They can't make babies that way.
They have to do it different for that.

284
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:09,254
So this one's got a hacksaw

285
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:11,837
and he's gotta cut his own foot off.

286
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,045
So, the terrorist guy...

287
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:16,373
OK, OK, keep an eye on the knife.

288
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,749
See?

289
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:23,542
He's gonna take his whole head off!

290
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:28,881
Be good, sweetie.

291
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:19,879
Hey. Good boy, Petey.

292
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,422
You hang on in there.

293
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:35,129
- You added something.
- Oh, it's like a new kind of probiotic.

294
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:37,670
- It keeps your stools firm.
- Oh, Jesus, Mom.

295
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:44,212
Oh, you've got to be kidding! When
was the last time you went anywhere?

296
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,545
That's not dancing.

297
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:48,962
She said he was English.

298
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:51,837
- He's not English.
- He said "cup of tea," or something.

299
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,879
Doesn't mean anything.
Susan's an idiot.

300
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:55,922
Hey, it's Trick.

301
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:59,047
Holy fuck, he's got wheels!

302
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:00,756
Yo, Trick!

303
00:24:01,464 --> 00:24:03,379
Hey, guys. What's up?

304
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:05,772
- Interesting hair.
- Shut up.

305
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,315
I'm fucking with you. It's cool.

306
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,379
- How are you doing?
- Didn't know you cared.

307
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:12,672
Maybe I don't.

308
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:16,424
- You a delivery guy now?
- Kinda, of sorts.

309
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,004
Shut up.

310
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:21,381
Hmm... So intriguing. I gotta go.

311
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:24,409
Hey, uh, we're headed to Lake Dalston

312
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:25,883
later if you girls want to hang.

313
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:28,504
We'll think about it.

314
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:31,254
- It'll be fun.
- Why don't you just come?

315
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:32,464
Come on!

316
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,997
Like my dad's gonna
let me set foot in Trick's van.

317
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,170
Look, we tell our folks
we're at Reilly's for movie night.

318
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:41,583
Oh, come on, it'll work.

319
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:43,086
It's worth a shot, I guess.

320
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,214
So, anyhow...

321
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:50,459
- You and, uh, Trick, huh?
- What?

322
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,797
I'm not gonna do anything.

323
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:58,920
- Yeah, OK. Sure.
- Oh, fuck you!

324
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,587
Hey!

325
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:05,545
Yay! You're home.

326
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:09,795
Not for long. I was gonna go to
Reilly's with Meryl. Movie night.

327
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:11,891
Oh, I thought movie
night was on Wednesday.

328
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:14,337
Her mom's got guests over
then, so we're doing tonight.

329
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:16,879
Gonna watch some vintage thing.
The Breakfast Gang.

330
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,754
The Breakfast Club.

331
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,504
That's it.

332
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:23,462
Um, be home, like, 11:30.
Her mom will drop me back.

333
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:25,962
Well, I might be heading out, too. So...

334
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:28,337
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

335
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,962
OK. Last one home's a rotten egg.

336
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:31,881
OK!

337
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:57,392
Hey, there. How you doing?

338
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:02,797
You look hot. Later.

339
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,031
I don't know...

340
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:32,212
She called me fat. I got over it.
I still remember it...

341
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:34,339
- Would you like some?
- Yeah, sure.

342
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:46,462
- What was that?
- I heard it.

343
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,254
Cold?

344
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,337
Only a bit.

345
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,464
Come here.

346
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,172
It's late.

347
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:08,297
I should go.

348
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,089
Same time next week?

349
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,795
Hi, it's Sara.
Leave a message. Make it good.

350
00:27:22,797 --> 00:27:25,668
Hey, it's Mom. All right, call me.

351
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:28,005
OK? All right, bye.

352
00:27:32,006 --> 00:27:35,087
- Hey.
- Hi, Ava. I was just wondering

353
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,712
if the girls were done with the movie.

354
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:37,837
What movie?

355
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,337
- Breakfast Club?
- They never ended up here.

356
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:42,964
- They didn't?
- No. Do you want to speak to Reilly?

357
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:46,420
I don't know. I must
have got my wires crossed.

358
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,422
- OK, thanks.
- All right.

359
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:51,254
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Marie.

360
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:53,629
I was wondering if Sara
and Meryl were together.

361
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,545
They said they were
headed down to Reilly's.

362
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:57,045
No, I haven't seen them.

363
00:27:57,047 --> 00:27:59,295
- Hi, it's Marie, Sara's mom.
- Oh, hi.

364
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:00,879
- Yeah, I was just...
- What's up?

365
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:03,129
- Have you heard from her?
- Uh... no.

366
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:05,712
I'm sorry, I know it's late. I
was wondering, have you seen her?

367
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:08,172
- No. Everything OK?
- No, everything's fine.

368
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,837
Hi, it's Sara.
Leave a message. Make it good.

369
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,295
Um, hey, it's Mom.
Where are you? Call me.

370
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:20,045
Hi, it's Sara.
Leave a message. Make it good.

371
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,131
Sara?

372
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:27,506
Sara?

373
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:55,422
Come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on.

374
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,256
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

375
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:11,047
What is that?

376
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:19,837
Fuck me harder.

377
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:22,129
Fuck me.

378
00:29:22,131 --> 00:29:24,212
- Oh, God, oh...
- Please.

379
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:25,297
Oh.

380
00:29:27,881 --> 00:29:28,756
Oh.

381
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:33,214
Oh...

382
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:36,254
Here. Let me do it.

383
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:38,297
My hands are warm.

384
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:42,297
- You gotta be a liar.
- What?

385
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,589
You said you'd never done that before.

386
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,977
No way you never done that before.

387
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,631
Swear to God.

388
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:59,429
You know, you didn't
have to talk like that.

389
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,506
Like what?

390
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:04,381
Like the porn stuff.

391
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:11,214
I mean, like, you don't have
to talk like that... for me.

392
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:13,297
OK.

393
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,547
What?

394
00:30:18,214 --> 00:30:21,214
Just... just you.

395
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:26,131
What about me?

396
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:35,381
You know...

397
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:38,379
You've got muscles, but...

398
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:39,756
...you're a pussy.

399
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,962
Yeah.

400
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,375
I'm busted. My mom knows
I'm not at Reilly's.

401
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:55,462
- Huh?
- Yeah, I mean...

402
00:30:55,464 --> 00:30:56,922
We gotta go, OK?

403
00:30:57,893 --> 00:30:59,560
- Come on.
- Fuck.

404
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:20,254
No lights.
Maybe she's still out.

405
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:21,797
Pretty sure she had a date.

406
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,504
Maybe she got laid.

407
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:27,672
Oh, please, that's gross.

408
00:31:28,297 --> 00:31:32,712
- Sorry.
- Check out that laugh.

409
00:31:32,714 --> 00:31:34,797
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

410
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:46,547
Later.

411
00:32:11,256 --> 00:32:12,256
Sara?

412
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,964
- Sorry, Mom. I am a little late.
- It's OK.

413
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,047
How was Reilly?

414
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,256
She's great.

415
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,123
I gotta go to bed.

416
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:25,754
- OK.
- Night, Mom.

417
00:32:25,756 --> 00:32:26,922
I love you.

418
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,256
Hmm, probiotics.

419
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:53,672
I gotta go. I'm gonna be a
little late back from school.

420
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,172
Oh, yeah?

421
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,004
Said I'd help Meryl with a project.
She's being a dork about it, so...

422
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:01,545
- OK.
- See ya!

423
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:02,672
Bye!

424
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:09,422
- Have a good afternoon.
- Thank you, dear.

425
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,756
All right. What do you think?

426
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,087
OK, that's awesome, but I
can't put that on the van.

427
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:34,587
- Why not?
- Well, A, it's not my van,

428
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:37,506
and, B, it's better if I'm anonymous.

429
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:40,714
For your special delivery?

430
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:43,339
Maybe, yeah.

431
00:33:44,464 --> 00:33:47,420
- You got any on you?
- Any what?

432
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:50,339
Oh, come on, Trick. I'm not
dumb. I know what you sell.

433
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:52,254
You got any?

434
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,295
It's not for you.

435
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:55,920
Bet it's in your backpack.

436
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:58,587
- Under the seat... with tape.
- Sara, come here.

437
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,587
- Hey, Sara, give me that.
- Duct tape.

438
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,629
Give me that. No, no, no.

439
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:05,231
- I bet it's in the pocket.
- Come on, give me that. No!

440
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:08,462
I'm making a little money on
the side so I can move out, OK?

441
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,254
It's not like I use that shit.

442
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,422
Have you tried it?

443
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:14,587
Of course I've tried it but, I
mean, it's not even good coke,

444
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:15,670
it's, like, average.

445
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:17,317
It's for people who like to talk about

446
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,049
themselves all the time. Yada yada yada.

447
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:22,920
- Show me what it looks like.
- Mm-mm.

448
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:25,089
Come on. I just want to see.

449
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:27,386
Please.

450
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:39,756
Are you sure it's not sugar?

451
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:43,589
Go away.

452
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,964
So, one of the things people
do is they put it, like...

453
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,629
- under their gum, bottom gum.
- OK.

454
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:53,964
So...

455
00:34:57,672 --> 00:34:59,587
Oh, ew...

456
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:02,422
Gross.

457
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:06,212
All right, let's, uh, let's put it back.

458
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:08,589
- I don't think you should...
- I want to try some.

459
00:35:09,422 --> 00:35:10,922
Just a little, just once.

460
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:14,339
Just once.

461
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,297
Whoa!

462
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,359
Ah!

463
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:00,670
- Hi, can I help?
- I'm just looking.

464
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:02,087
Ma'am?

465
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:04,837
Excuse me? Are you Ryan Tribecky?

466
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,226
- You stay away from my daughter.
- Uh... I don't know what...

467
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:11,170
Sara. You know exactly what I'm
talking about. You stay away.

468
00:37:11,172 --> 00:37:15,920
- OK, she's...
- She is 15, you junkie piece of shit.

469
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:17,462
You want the cops in on this?

470
00:37:17,464 --> 00:37:20,045
- I didn't do anything.
- I will show them what you did.

471
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:24,462
OK, you stay away from her,
or I will show them this. OK?

472
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:26,031
You still got that system?

473
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:29,670
Yes, I have it. So whatever she
sees, I see, and I am watching you.

474
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:31,129
- OK.
- So you stay away.

475
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:33,254
OK, if she calls you, you hang up.

476
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:35,587
If she comes to see you,
you tell her to get away.

477
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,587
- You just stay away from her.
- I'll stay away.

478
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,964
You stay the fuck away.

479
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:54,464
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

480
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,504
The mailbox
you're attempting to reach is full.

481
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:33,583
Please try again.

482
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:29,922
Sara?

483
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:36,631
Hey, dinner's ready.

484
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:39,254
I'm not hungry.

485
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:40,631
It's Mexican.

486
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,087
Please, I just...

487
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,089
I'm tired, and I want to sleep, OK?

488
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,006
OK.

489
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,461
So you're cutting me out.

490
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,714
Standard dick move.
That's what this is, right?

491
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,879
Look at me.

492
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:23,214
- Why can't you just look at me?
- It was a mistake.

493
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,504
It didn't seem like a mistake
from where I was laying.

494
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:29,922
I can't be with you.

495
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:33,797
What the fuck?

496
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:39,339
I don't want to be with you.

497
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,089
I don't want you, OK?

498
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:49,881
You know what?

499
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:52,589
Fuck you.

500
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,297
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

501
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:49,920
OK, so why is he so down?

502
00:42:49,922 --> 00:42:51,756
Oedipus says things like:

503
00:42:53,523 --> 00:42:57,315
"Let the storm burst, my
fixed resolve still holds." Or:

504
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:02,087
"Nothing can make me
other than what I am."

505
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:04,087
He still holds himself
morally responsible.

506
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:06,420
He doesn't blame fate for
what's happened to him.

507
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:09,962
Moral responsibility implies
the existence of free will,

508
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:13,087
but actually...

509
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:26,422
- You feeling any better?
- Uh-huh.

510
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:29,504
So, listen...

511
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,339
I had to run some tests, in
case we had a noro outbreak here.

512
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:36,506
Honey, it was the EC
pill that made you sick.

513
00:43:37,506 --> 00:43:40,506
- EC?
- Emergency contraception.

514
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,672
For terminating your pregnancy.

515
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,622
There's no...
There's no pregnancy.

516
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:52,429
Seriously, I'm... I'm not...

517
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:57,254
I can't... I haven't...

518
00:43:57,256 --> 00:43:58,547
I understand, sweetheart.

519
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:02,420
And it will work, in
spite of the vomiting.

520
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:04,670
You don't have to worry about that.

521
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:06,131
You're not pregnant anymore.

522
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:12,547
I gotta put it in your file,
but I don't have to flag it.

523
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:15,964
And I want you to know I got your back.

524
00:45:37,922 --> 00:45:39,797
Please.

525
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:23,339
Sara?

526
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:33,507
Sara?

527
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:02,129
You watched me.

528
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:03,337
No, I... honey...

529
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:04,962
- Honey...
- You watched me with him.

530
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:07,797
- I... No, I didn't mean to.
- Give it to me.

531
00:47:08,797 --> 00:47:10,712
Give it...

532
00:47:10,714 --> 00:47:13,462
I was trying to protect you.
I was trying to keep you safe.

533
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:14,962
How do you turn it off?

534
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:17,712
Everything I've done, I've done for you.

535
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:19,420
- Honey, I love you...
- Shut up!

536
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:21,087
Sara...

537
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,212
Shut up!

538
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,547
Sara! Sara!

539
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:27,879
Sara...

540
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:39,879
Filter off, off, off...

541
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:40,968
Off...

542
00:48:57,922 --> 00:48:59,339
Sara?

543
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:03,289
Sara?

544
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:06,724
Sara?

545
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:10,367
- I love you.
- Sara!

546
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:12,734
Sara!

547
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:18,547
No... No...

548
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:23,587
Sara!

549
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,922
Sara!

550
00:49:30,631 --> 00:49:32,299
Sara!

551
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:08,312
