00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:15,401
Hello?

3
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,142
Ah...

4
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,182
Hello?

5
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:28,742
Hello.

6
00:04:57,342 --> 00:04:58,822
Can you help me?

7
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:03,302
Do you know who I am? I... I...

8
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:08,182
I can't remember who I am.

9
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,141
Hello?

10
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:30,221
Do you know who I am?

11
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,661
Please!

12
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:33,302
I can't remember.

13
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:14,622
Lady, help me!

14
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,581
Help me!

15
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:18,782
Help me, please.

16
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,221
Oh! Help!

17
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,702
Help me. He's got a gun! Help me!

18
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,901
Hey! We have to go!

19
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,821
Come on!

20
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,222
Oh, my god! Help!

21
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,141
Oh, my god!

22
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,141
Stay back!

23
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,582
Back! Get back!

24
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,262
Get back. Back!

25
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,022
Let me in. Let me in!

26
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,982
Help me! Help me!

27
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:11,982
Shit!

28
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,182
There's a door round there.

29
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:20,261
It's locked.

30
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,260
You don't know that!

31
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,342
There's a keypad.

32
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,021
We should try it.

33
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,662
Get down! Anybody stands up,
they'll shoot their heads off.

34
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:30,141
He's trying to kill me!
What's going on?

35
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,100
Shut up! I'm trying to think!

36
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,462
He can see you. Get back.

37
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:39,421
Oh, my god!
What's wrong with those people?!

38
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,940
Why aren't they helping us?
They're just watching...

39
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,302
Where the fuck have you been?

40
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,581
What?

41
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:46,662
Get that extinguisher.

42
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,021
I can't! I can't do it!

43
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:51,621
Get it. Get it now!

44
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:54,181
OK... OK... OK...
OK... OK...

45
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,542
Come on.

46
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,782
Quickly. Slide it to me.

47
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,862
Damien, if he climbs through, you
grab him and you grab his gun.

48
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,861
I can't...

49
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:05,621
You can.

50
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:06,781
He'll shoot me!

51
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:08,141
You have to!

52
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,460
I'm going to smash the lock off that
door, you help him with gun guy.

53
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:14,420
He can't shoot all of us.
If he fires, he has to reload.

54
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,222
We either rush him or run, OK?

55
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:17,381
I can't do this!

56
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,341
We have no choice!

57
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,342
Help him.

58
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,381
Urgh!

59
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,741
Damien!

60
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:25,942
Oh, my...

61
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,702
Get him!

62
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:48,502
Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!

63
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,341
Get down.

64
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,582
Shh!

65
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,342
Fuck!

66
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,662
Shh!

67
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,662
No.

68
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,222
We have to go, come on.

69
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:57,382
Shit.

70
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,062
Stay down.

71
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:03,422
Shit.

72
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,862
Stay down.

73
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,980
Who are they?
Why do they look like that?

74
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,662
They like scaring people.

75
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,662
What?

76
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:23,421
OK. We have to run for that opening.

77
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,061
No, they'll see us.

78
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:27,342
If they're busy with him
we can lose the hunters, OK?

79
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:28,621
No.

80
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:29,982
You just stay with me. OK?

81
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:30,981
OK.

82
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:32,262
Ready... Come on...

83
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,648
Wait.

84
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,208
Wait!

85
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:54,543
The onlookers sometimes wait
in the windows, keeping lookout.

86
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:58,343
I'm pretty sure that's how they find
us. Through the cameras somehow.

87
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:01,303
Onlookers spot you and a few minutes
later the scary bastards turn up.

88
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:02,984
This is mad, this is just mad.

89
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,706
Hold it together and do
what I say or you'll get us killed.

90
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,945
I...

91
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:11,624
I woke up in this house and I don't
even know if it's my house.

92
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,426
I don't even know who I am.

93
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,105
You must know something.

94
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,665
Ah!

95
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,865
I think this is my daughter.

96
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:20,648
But you don't know?

97
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,729
She could be anywhere.

98
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:27,409
Maybe you tried to kill yourself.
Would that explain it?

99
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,688
There was pills.

100
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,968
I don't blame you.

101
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,487
Lots have tried that fun
fork in the road since it started.

102
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:33,649
Since what started?

103
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,768
You really don't know?

104
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,248
No.

105
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:41,007
There was a signal... Like pictures,
flashing pictures.

106
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,209
They just appeared on every TV,
every computer,

107
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,008
anything with a screen.

108
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,208
Argh!

109
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,528
Ugh!

110
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:51,369
I saw it. I saw it.

111
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,769
Get down.

112
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,528
They did something to people.

113
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,647
Like, almost everybody just became
onlookers,

114
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,527
started watching, filming stuff,

115
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:08,487
like spectators who don't give a
shit about what happens.

116
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,509
That's, like, nine
out of ten people now.

117
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:11,931
But not us.

118
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,970
Some of us weren't affected.
I don't know why.

119
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:16,330
Like that man with the gun
and that woman.

120
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,370
I call them "hunters". You might've
noticed that's what they do.

121
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,330
They seemed normal, but they
realised

122
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:22,930
they could do what they wanted

123
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:26,370
and they started taking stuff,
nicking cars cos they could,

124
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,490
doing what they like and not just
with things, with people.

125
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:32,810
It got worse and worse.
And now they've got an audience.

126
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:35,212
So this... This thing on the TV,
the...

127
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,411
The signal.

128
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:38,850
That's what's making them act like
this?

129
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:41,050
I guess they were always like that
underneath.

130
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,810
Just needed the rules to change,
for no-one to intervene.

131
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,212
What we going to do?
What we going to do?

132
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,291
Do? Do nothing. We get out.

133
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,211
Where's "out"?

134
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,930
We're here.
We need to head south of here.

135
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,292
They've knocked the transmitters
out, it's OK there.

136
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,731
The TV transmitters, they carry it.

137
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,010
There's only one between us

138
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,812
and the safe zone and we're going to
knock it out. See, it's here.

139
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:02,932
White Bear.

140
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,731
What?

141
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:08,892
White Bear...

142
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,171
Uh! Ungh!

143
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:20,852
A picnic with my
two best friends.

144
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:28,530
Jesus, what is it with you?

145
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:30,412
White Bear, you said White Bear...

146
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:31,612
So?!

147
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:36,612
Look, whatever's wrong with you,
you have to keep it together. OK?

148
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:39,411
Listen to me! Don't go out there.

149
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:40,652
What's your problem?

150
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,091
Huh? You want something to look at?

151
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,092
Cos I'll give you something
to look at!

152
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,892
No, I want to talk to him.

153
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,331
I want to talk to you!

154
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,611
Ah!

155
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,892
It's not so funny now, is it?

156
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:00,332
Put it down.

157
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,132
I just want to see what
they're looking at.

158
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,891
I said put it down.

159
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,770
It's dangerous.
Their phones, they're dangerous.

160
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:11,412
It's the signal. The images are
on them, they're on the screen.

161
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:12,891
What?

162
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:14,891
Don't look at it!

163
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:15,892
Don't look at it.

164
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,892
'Jemima...'

165
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,890
No, no. This is all wrong.
This is all wrong!

166
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:34,412
They're coming. Run! Run!

167
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,451
Get in.

168
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,852
Get in. Come on.

169
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:51,852
Come on.

170
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:56,571
Come on, now! They're coming!
Quick.

171
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,852
Come on, hurry up. Get in.

172
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,410
You nearly killed us back there.

173
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,332
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting you
to be there, was I?

174
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,731
I just saved your lives.
A wee 'thank you' would be nice.

175
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,011
I should've just run yous over.

176
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,451
Who are you?

177
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,531
Who are you?

178
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,772
It's not a hard question, is it?

179
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,531
I know... I know you.

180
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:37,052
Do you? Well, where did we meet,
if you know me?

181
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,570
No. Didn't think so, yeah.

182
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,892
She's not in a good way.

183
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,572
Yeah, I'll say.

184
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,532
So what are yous doing out here
anyway?

185
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,291
Heading south.

186
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,610
That's not a good move.
It's all blocked up down there.

187
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,050
There's a transmitter there...

188
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,610
I don't think you understand.

189
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:58,612
When I said, "It's not a good move",

190
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:02,531
that means I'm not driving
you down there.

191
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,731
I know a safe place we can go.

192
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,411
The woods.

193
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,370
Your safe place is in the woods.

194
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:09,492
How'd you know that?

195
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,531
I don't... I don't know.

196
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,332
Christ, maybe you do know me.

197
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,971
Yeah, we pull up and we get out.

198
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:21,852
We talk. There's no-one chasing us.

199
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:23,051
Mystic Meg.

200
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,332
And then what happens?

201
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,532
We eat.

202
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,371
Told you. No bars.

203
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:42,972
They'll never find us here.

204
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:48,411
That your daughter?

205
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:50,051
Yeah, I think so.

206
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,771
Where is she?

207
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:53,131
I don't know.

208
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:54,492
What'd you do to your wrists?

209
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:55,931
Don't know.

210
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,852
History of mental illness?

211
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,131
Yeah, I bet you do. Lay money on it.

212
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,771
What about you?

213
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,891
What about me?

214
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,772
Mental illness, weaknesses...

215
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:09,690
Everyone's got weaknesses.

216
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:12,490
Yeah, you two have got more
that most, I'd say.

217
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:16,412
That's why you're on the receiving
end, you see. Vulnerable.

218
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,531
Receiving end of what?

219
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:22,971
This. Everything that's going on.
Easy pickings.

220
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,931
What's your weaknesses then?

221
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,331
My weaknesses?

222
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:29,132
Show you if you want.
You want to see it?

223
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:32,932
Wait there don't move.
You're going to like this.

224
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,131
Not a lot.

225
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:36,930
This better not be naturism.

226
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,132
Yeah, in your dreams.

227
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,211
Tada!

228
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,132
Run and I'll shoot you in the back.

229
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,651
Right, come over here.

230
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:48,692
Stand there.

231
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:56,491
You, here, put this on.

232
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,892
Put it on. Backwards,
so it covers your eyes.

233
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:11,170
Put your hands on her shoulders.
Keep them there.

234
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:13,052
You're her eyes now, all right?

235
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:16,771
And that is a shotgun, OK?

236
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,930
If I pull this trigger, it's going
to cut you, both in half.

237
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,732
So no funny business, all right?

238
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,211
Right, off you go.

239
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:26,452
Straight ahead.
Keep going through the trees.

240
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,731
Come on, pick up the pace.

241
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:34,610
Got a lovely
playground for you down there.

242
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,052
That's it, through here.

243
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,252
That's it, straight ahead.

244
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,412
Grab her!

245
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:52,772
Right, now take her balaclava off.

246
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,172
Get down there.

247
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:30,532
Oh, fuck.

248
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:33,852
Come on.

249
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:36,892
Head towards that ladder.

250
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,051
Get down there.

251
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:46,692
Right, stop. Get on your knees, both
of you. Give me that bag.

252
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,731
Fucking bag.

253
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:50,132
You, get down.

254
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:52,612
Stop whingeing.

255
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,012
Stop fucking crying.

256
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,131
Stop it. Eurgh!

257
00:19:58,688 --> 00:19:59,888
Yeah.

258
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,126
I'm down in that wood spot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.

259
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,366
I'll just lash them to a tree or
something like that.

260
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,506
Just hurry up and get down here.
I want to get started.

261
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,562
It's going to piss... Fuck!

262
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:20,704
Your mate's fucked off. You're in
double trouble now, missus.

263
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:23,183
Get up on that log. Now! move!

264
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:26,104
Get your hands through there.
Get your hands through there!

265
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,823
Right through.

266
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:31,463
Push your arms up. Push them!

267
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,984
Get them up there!

268
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:39,823
Are we going to put a show on for
these guys today, eh?

269
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:41,472
Eh?

270
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:48,454
Let's see what Daddy's got in the
bag, shall we? Oh...

271
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,614
Oh! Oh, mama.

272
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:55,094
Help me! Help me!

273
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,414
Please, just help me!

274
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,574
Why are you doing this to me?

275
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,095
Whoa-ha! Oh yeah!

276
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:06,814
Help me, please. I'm a human being!

277
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,533
They're not going to help you.
They're going to watch.

278
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,213
What I'm going to do here darling,

279
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,575
is just going to push this
straight through your...

280
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:16,855
Help me!

281
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,634
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you!

282
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,411
For what?

283
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:44,251
For coming back for me.

284
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:45,532
I came back for this.

285
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,332
There's more like him on the way.

286
00:22:01,412 --> 00:22:02,652
Come on.

287
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,149
Whitebear's not far from here.

288
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,869
If we step on it we might be able
to shut it down before they get us.

289
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,815
- What happens if we can't shut it down?
- We can.

290
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:55,494
How? Do we hack into it,
or something?

291
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:57,880
We don't hack anything.
We burn the control room down.

292
00:22:57,881 --> 00:23:00,722
It's not hard, we just slosh a load
of petrol round, strike a light

293
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:03,401
and fucks the electrics
or something.

294
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:05,001
Here.

295
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:06,322
In the bag.

296
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:09,922
It's the plans
for the transmitter compound.

297
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:14,482
I've been planning this, you know.

298
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:23,041
Jemima?

299
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,361
Lie down for me, darling. Go on.

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,121
It's a game.

301
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:29,242
Yeah, just like what Teddy does.

302
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,882
Lie down for me, darling.

303
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:37,842
Turn around!

304
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:38,881
What?

305
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:41,960
White Bear, there's something not
right about White Bear. I remember!

306
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,202
You "remembered" the woods, too.
Sorry if I don't trust your hunches.

307
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,442
OK. Looks clear.

308
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:07,682
OK.

309
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,882
He was good for something,
after all.

310
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:46,321
Hurry up, we need to go!

311
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:49,242
Come on... Get out...

312
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,442
Come with me...

313
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:03,362
A picnic with my two best friends.

314
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:07,882
Come on.

315
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,122
This way.

316
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:19,920
Oh, shit. They'll be here
any minute. Give me the plan.

317
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:21,880
The transmitter tower's over there

318
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,642
and the cabling runs
underground into that building.

319
00:25:24,643 --> 00:25:26,242
Come on!

320
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:38,002
Thought so.

321
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:45,642
Let's go!

322
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:05,682
Get back.

323
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:09,562
Or everything goes up.
I mean it... Stay back.

324
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:14,482
Stay back.

325
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:27,035
Wh, wh, wha, what...?

326
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:32,835
Thank you.

327
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:39,794
So. I guess you're wondering
why you're here?

328
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:42,453
Well,
it's time to tell you who you are.

329
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:52,456
You've looked better.

330
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,305
Do you recognise him?

331
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:01,984
Uh... Yeah.

Your fiance, lain Rannoch.

333
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:07,345
Or, should I say, was your fiance.

334
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:17,065
In case you haven't guessed,
the pair of you aren't very popular.

335
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:20,064
But I'll tell you what you are
though.

336
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:21,424
You're famous.

Murderer!

There were no tears
when you watched him do what he did.

375

You filmed what he did.
A poor wee girl.

Helpless and terrified
and you just watched.

Thank you so much
for coming tonight. OK!

Take as many photographs as you
want, take as many photographs

390
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:40,824
as you can, but most importantly,
what I need from you

391
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:44,705
is to shout and scream and let that
bitch know that youse are out here.

Let's get this show on the road!

Murdering bitch!

Burn in hell!

399

Kill me. Please just kill me.

400
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:25,464
Please...

401
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:27,025
That's what you always say.

♪ Doo-ba-doo-ba-do... ♪

403
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:40,703
You've had a bad day,
but this will wipe it clean.

404
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,145
Get you in the mood to start again.

405
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:46,944
No! Please! Get off me!
What are you doing?

406
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,545
Takes about 30 minutes...

407
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:55,624
for it to fully
do the business.

408
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,705
So while it does...

409
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:02,745
Why don't we watch
some in-flight entertainment?

410
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,465
Please, no.

411
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:10,224
'Healthy stuff, like apples'.

412
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:12,264
Please stop.

413
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:14,984
You should enjoy this.

414
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,344
You shot it.

415
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:20,825
'Made it together,
so that my two friends...'

416
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:30,105
'Erm... A picnic for me
and my two best friends.'

417
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:00,665
Help me.

418
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,023
'OK everyone, we're about to head
into the park

419
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,625
so I'll hand you over to Baxter.'

420
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,144
Thank you.

421
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:08,103
All of our roles are very,
very important, yours included.

422
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,025
Now, yours come
with some basic rules.

423
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:12,784
Rule number one, no talking,

424
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:16,543
not just to her, but each other
as well, unless it's essential.

425
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,865
We're trying to get her to believe
that youse are all mesmerised.

426
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:23,745
I know, I know, I know,
but she's believed it up to now.

427
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:29,024
Morning, ticket please.
Thank you.

428
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:32,264
'OK, rule number two,
keep your distance.'

429
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:34,943
I can't stress the importance
of this one enough, OK?

430
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:37,425
Don't forget,
she's a dangerous individual.

431
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:40,584
Imagine that she's an escaped lion.

432
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,383
Now yesterday, she threw
a projectile, and we will step in

433
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:46,263
if she gets too close.
We're all equipped with tasers,

434
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:48,943
but then we're into story shutdown
and we've all wasted a day.

435
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:51,545
So it's best to keep your distance
at least three metres back.

436
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,545
You can use your camera zoom.

437
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,504
'Last, but not least,
enjoy yourself'.

438
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,303
That's probably the most
important rule of all, OK?

439
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:04,463
Take photographs, run around through
the woods, but try and stay safe.

440
00:39:04,464 --> 00:39:06,905
We'll be keeping an eye on you,
making sure you're all OK.

441
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:08,144
So get out there,

442
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,785
enjoy yourselves and let's make
this show happen, people! Come on!

443
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,985
Ow!

444
00:39:46,665 --> 00:39:48,025
Look, there she is.

445
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,425
'Don't know yet.
I'm kind of knackered.'

446
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:58,424
Me, too.

447
00:39:58,425 --> 00:40:01,345
'She's just leaving her house now.
Two minutes tops.'

448
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:04,025
Right, you are. We're on.

449
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,625
Watch out!

450
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:37,943
He's trying to fucking kill me.
What's going on?

451
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:39,425
'Get that extinguisher.'

452
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:43,185
It's OK, they've gone.

453
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,545
Convincing, eh?

454
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,625
We got two minutes.

455
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:05,745
Help!

456
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:12,305
Help me!

457
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,064
'Early screamer.'

458
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:32,145
It's an early screamer tonight.
So keep the noise up and let's go!

459
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,441
Ow!

460
