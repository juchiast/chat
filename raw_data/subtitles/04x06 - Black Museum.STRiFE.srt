16
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Mm-hmm.

17
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,280
- Hi.
- Hey.

18
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,160
Tours begin at 11. You're the
first in line. Could be a busy day.

19
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Road seemed pretty empty.

20
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,280
Nice accent. You from Australia?

21
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,840
No, I'm from Britain.

22
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,400
So you got one of those crazy
British names? Esmeralda or, uh... ?

23
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm Nish.

24
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,480
- Nish?
- Nish.

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,560
Well, I can't judge.
My name's ridiculous.

26
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,680
Rolo Haynes. Owner. Proprietor.

27
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Well, just us two this morning.
You sure you wanna do this?

28
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,040
- This place ain't for the faint-hearted.
- I'm sure I can handle it.

29
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,960
Not everyone can.

30
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,640
So, I have to peek in your
little sack there if that's OK.

31
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,280
- Ah. That's OK.
- Can't trust anyone these days.

32
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,400
If you could step through there.

33
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,000
Anything metal, put it in here.

34
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Cool.

35
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,720
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm. Dinky.

36
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,600
Oh, yeah. I call it fun size.

37
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Fun size. I like that.

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,960
Guessing you had a gut full of
this security shit at the airport.

39
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,600
Our immigration guys are
pretty tight these days.

40
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,520
All clear?

41
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
OK.

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,360
Show on the road.

43
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,720
So, you on vacation?

44
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,920
- Sort of. My dad lives out here.
- Uh-huh.

45
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,200
It's his birthday, so my mom
just wants to surprise him.

46
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
And you're the surprise?

47
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
Hmm, part of it, I guess.

48
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,680
- Where'd you fly in?
- Salt Lake.

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
You came here from Salt Lake?

50
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,800
Yeah, I thought it'd be
nice to drive the back route,

51
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
but I underestimated the...

52
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Heck of a trip for a girl on her own.

53
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,480
- I don't mean to get
old-fashioned on you. - Seriously?

54
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
That is quite old-fashioned.

55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,680
It's hot as hell in here.

56
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,360
AC must've shit the bed.

57
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,600
Sorry for the heat.

58
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
Goddamn digital systems.

59
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,040
Never trust a guy in tech.
Jesus, I should know that.

60
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
So what is all this stuff?

61
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,760
Authentic criminological artifacts.

62
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,840
If it did something bad,
chances are it's in here.

63
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,600
Take a look around, take your
time, see what pops out at you.

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,600
Anything piques your interest,
I can tell you all about it.

65
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,640
There's a sad, sick story
behind most everything here.

66
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Just like our main
attraction just through there.

67
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,520
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

68
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,920
A lot of folks just
rush behind the curtain,

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
hardly even eyeball this stuff,

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,967
and then it's a bunch
of one-star ratings

71
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,160
on Trip-fucker and before you know it...

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,320
Yo, look, I am not in
a rush, so don't worry.

73
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,920
Well, then, take your time.

74
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,480
I shall.

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,920
- This stuff looks techie.
- Well, neuro tech was my background.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sweet.

77
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,520
So, what's this, then? Looks
like a hairdressing thing.

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,560
Actually, that was one of
my very first souvenirs.

79
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,880
Sheds a little light on how
our main exhibit came to be.

80
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,200
- What is it?
- You heard of Peter Dawson?

81
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,560
- Mnh-mnh.
- Dr. Peter Dawson?

82
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,760
Well, usually I say this is
Dawson's Symphatic Diagnoser,

83
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,120
and folks shriek, "No way," and
I'm like, "Oh, it very much is."

84
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
"How the heck did you get
that?" is the next question.

85
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,520
- OK.
- My domain was med tech.

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,920
I worked out of St. Juniper's. It's
kind of like a university hospital.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,440
Sweet setup. Part of
the Land Act, actually.

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,920
It was in downtown New
York, big old building.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
Research up top,

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,960
emergency room and the great
unwashed down at street level.

91
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,960
It was the perfect mix of
business and health care.

92
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,080
- Seriously?
- Out of the way, asshole!

93
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,960
Idea was folks with no coverage
signed up for free health care

94
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,720
in exchange for consenting to
occasional experimental treatments.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,680
I... I... I worked for the guys up top.

96
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
What, like a scientist?

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,560
I was more sort of... recruitment.

98
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,800
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
- Clear.

99
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Shocking.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,080
- No.
- No?

101
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
- No.
- OK, I'm going again. Clear. Clear!

102
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
Shocking.

103
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,960
No.

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,040
If I'd known she was on tricyclics,
I would have nudged the dose.

105
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
You couldn't have known.

106
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
This a bad time?

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,720
Rolo Haynes from the tenth floor.

108
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,080
Seems you've been having some problems.

109
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,280
I think I got something that can help.

110
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,480
The big thing they're
into is neuro technics.

111
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Pioneering brain enhancements.

112
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Neural interfaces.

113
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,720
All that fun stuff.

114
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,600
The holy grail they've been aiming
for is a way to transfer knowledge.

115
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
So one of the teams here
is working on an experiment,

116
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,520
trying to find a way to beam
information from one brain to another.

117
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,520
This is Kenny.

118
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
This is Hector.

119
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,840
Stay with me on this.

120
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,560
So, the experiment.

121
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,200
They built a little maze and
they drop Kenny here into it

122
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,480
and he runs round over
and over for months on end

123
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,520
till he knows it like a childhood home.

124
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,800
And then... they put this on him.

125
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
It's a transmitter,

126
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,280
absorbing signals from Kenny's brain

127
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,120
which were sent to Hector over here.

128
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,040
Hector had our prototype
synaptic receiver fitted.

129
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,880
Now, remember, Hector had
never even set paw in the maze.

130
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,560
Plan was he'd now receive Kenny's
knowledge of the maze layout

131
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,120
and, boom, he'd be able
to solve it, first time.

132
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,520
- And did he?
- No.

133
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,960
Scrabbled around like
a rat, fucking imbecile.

134
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,520
So, um, why are you telling me this?

135
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,840
Because just as it becomes clear
that the maze thing's a bust,

136
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,120
one of our researchers
spills his coffee on Kenny.

137
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Hot coffee spills all over Kenny, so
obviously he's squealing like hell,

138
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,840
but so is Hector.

139
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,760
Turns out, we haven't discovered
how to share knowledge...

140
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,360
- But physical sensations.
- Bingo.

141
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,000
That's nuts. Holy shit.

142
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
And even nutsier shit,

143
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,400
Hector felt the burn,
but took no damage at all.

144
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,280
All of the experience,
none of the physical cost.

145
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
But how did he die?

146
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,760
They cut him open after
to see if he was OK.

147
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,880
Oh.

148
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,240
Anyhow, thanks to Hector's
sacrifice, we prototyped this.

149
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,920
A receiver for human experiences.

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,360
A neural implant. Only one of its kind.

151
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,960
This is why you brought me up here.

152
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,560
What's the biggest pain
in the ass with patients?

153
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,000
Finding out what's wrong
with them in the first place.

154
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,967
Half of the assholes that roll in here

155
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:16,880
can't even describe their symptoms.

156
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,960
They're... They're out cold
or concussed or drunk or dumb

157
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,120
or... two years old, or
they can't speak English.

158
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Imagine if you could feel
exactly what a patient feels,

159
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,000
minus the physical consequences.

160
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Like reading their minds.

161
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,800
So what do you say?

162
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,080
Gotta hand it to Dawson,
he lept at the chance.

163
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
Like, he was happy to do it.

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,560
- And it was only a short procedure.

165
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,760
Irreversible, but,
hey, he was a pioneer.

166
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,400
Plus, his mortality
rates were in the toilet,

167
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,160
so this was his best shot at redemption.

168
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,480
Does it hurt if I touch it?

169
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
I don't think so.

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,800
There's something kinda kinky about it.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
It's like the ultimate piercing.

172
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,280
If you're trying to make me
feel better, it's working.

173
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,560
Time for the trial run.

174
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,880
So this is where our hairnet
doohickey comes into play.

175
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,840
Theory was, if you slipped
it on a willing subject,

176
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,493
it'd absorb their physical sensations

177
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:35,640
and relay them to Dawson's implant.

178
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
We just had to find out if it worked.

179
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,000
Ow.

180
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
This one.

181
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,320
Houston, we got a miracle.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,360
Right off the bat,

183
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,280
Dawson gets to work
with the ailing public,

184
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,680
starts building up a kind of
mental library of physical symptoms.

185
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,766
Plan was, he'd get to
know how things felt

186
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,840
so that he could diagnose them quicker.

187
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,920
So, starts small in the ER, minor
fractures, that sort of thing.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,200
Soon graduates to bigger stuff.

189
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,880
Major injuries. Diseases.

190
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,560
Late-stage terminal stuff.

191
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,600
Dawson grit his teeth
and went through it all.

192
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,640
Say a kid comes in obviously in pain.

193
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,465
Doctors suspect appendicitis,

194
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,760
they'd hook him up to
Dawson just to be sure.

195
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,520
Dawson had felt appendicitis
many times by now,

196
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,040
so he knows if it's something more.

197
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,640
Caught things they
weren't even looking for.

198
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
Blastomas and so on.

199
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Good luck, man.

200
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,680
That man saved lives, no doubt about it.

201
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
- Good luck, huh?
- Bye.

202
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,000
- Stay in touch. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

203
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,680
That was nice.

204
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,200
And, incidentally,

205
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,680
if you'll allow me to be crude,

206
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,280
Dawson's symphatic diagnoser
came in handy in the bedroom.

207
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,040
His implant received
pleasurable sensations, too.

208
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,360
So if his girlfriend slipped on
that transmitting blue hairnet

209
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,960
and he tuned in his
little implant nubbin...

210
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
he didn't just feel
what he was feeling...

211
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,680
- I'm gonna come!
- ... but also felt what she was feeling.

212
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,606
Son of a bitch was experiencing

213
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,960
male and female orgasms
at the same time.

214
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,200
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

215
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,080
Oh, shit.

216
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,840
I can't get enough of your...

217
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,000
But?

218
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,600
- I'm sorry?
- Dawson's having a great time.

219
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,720
- There's gotta be a "but."
- Oh.

220
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,520
He's having a great time, but...

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
But...

222
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,000
Coming through. Coming through.

223
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,200
- Come on.
- Almost there.

224
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,080
One day, they rush in Senator Whitley.

225
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,680
He'd collapsed at some fundraiser.

226
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
No one could tell what in
hell was wrong with him.

227
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,520
- Lift.
- I got this.

228
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Dawson's hooked up.

229
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,760
- Be careful.
- OK.

230
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,080
- Jeez.
- And has the roughest ride.

231
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,200
- Pete?
- Like he's got no clue what this is.

232
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,240
- Pete?
- Just one more minute, please.

233
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,200
Let the man work.

234
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,800
It's a pain he's never known.

235
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
- Pete, he's flatlining.
- Just one more moment.

236
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
And then it happened.

237
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,240
Pete?

238
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,400
Dawson blacked out,
for, like, five minutes.

239
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,640
Turns out the senator had been poisoned,

240
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
a rare poison at that,
some kind of Russian shit.

241
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,000
He'd been into that whole thing.

242
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,600
But Dawson had experienced death
and come out the other side.

243
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,600
At the moment of death,.

244
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:58,640
a whole galaxy of synapses
fritzes out of existence

245
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,920
Tsunami of endorphins.

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And then there's this rolling dark
wave of nothing rushes in behind.

247
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,920
When he came round, they
ran every kind of test

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,760
and he was all systems
go, nothing wrong.

249
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
"Shaken but unharmed,"
they put on his report.

250
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,120
Next day, he was back up and at 'em.

251
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,000
But there was something wrong, right?

252
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,560
To go through all that without dying?

253
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,160
Fucked up his implant like that.

254
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,680
Oh, my God.

255
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,960
- I'm just gonna get some water.
- OK.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,840
Oh, goddamn it.

257
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,600
Fair to say his relationship
with pain had shifted a little.

258
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,000
Ah, that hurt like hell.

259
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,640
Now, he was into it.

260
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,200
He really threw himself
into his work after that.

261
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,560
He tried to hide it at first,
but thanks to that little nubbin,

262
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,240
the more pain he felt,
the more pleasure he got.

263
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,120
OK, no. Stop, stop.

264
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,440
Stop. OK, safe word. Stop!

265
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,840
- You said that we could try it.
- And we did.

266
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,280
Look, we tried the hair
pulling and that choke thing.

267
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm not into it, OK? It's just not me.

268
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,400
Maybe I should go.

269
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
No. No, please.

270
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,600
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,880
Stay. Please?

272
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,000
Ow. Pete!

273
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,600
I'm going.

274
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,000
See, it's like eating chilies.

275
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,840
You acclimatize fast.

276
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,360
First time you had a jalapeno,
bet you spat it out, too hot.

277
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,440
But persevere and it becomes addictive.

278
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,600
Soon, a jalapeno's not enough.

279
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,120
You work your way up, red-hot
chilies, bird's-eye chilies,

280
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
till you get to them
Scotch bonnet devils.

281
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,000
Dawson's craving was just the same.

282
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
Before you know it, he's
hanging around the ER

283
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,680
just waiting for a juicy
accident victim to latch onto.

284
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,240
All he can think about is that
next hit gnawing away up there.

285
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,680
"Give it back to me. Give it
back. I gotta have it back."

286
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,640
Sarah, will you just,
um, file these for me?

287
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,840
- Sure thing.
- Pete.

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,560
- This isn't your shift.
- Take him round to bay four.

289
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,960
- OK.
- I just...

290
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Pete.

291
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Careful.

292
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,040
And three, two, one.

293
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Lift.

294
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,440
Let me get this.

295
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,560
Soon as he jacks in, he feels it.

296
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,120
It's a cardiac arrest. She
collapsed in the street.

297
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
I just wanna be sure.

298
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,560
It's a heart attack all
right, but he says nothing.

299
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,840
Plays for time.

300
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,640
Figures he can ride that pain train
all the way through to nirvana.

301
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,080
Eventually they have to physically
pull Dawson away from her.

302
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,480
Give Aunt Ethel her CPR.

303
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,880
She flatlines in front of
him, and he's like an alcoholic

304
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,640
watching someone pour a glass
of good Scotch down the sink,

305
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,600
sick at the waste of good shit.

306
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,920
Look, we always knew going into
this there might be side effects.

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
I mean, we can look
into how we deactivate,

308
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,201
but it's gonna take some time.

309
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:07,000
I can't just pull all the people
off the other projects, Pete.

310
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,760
I mean, we have milestones
to hit. You know the drill.

311
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,520
But we'll get there.

312
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,760
In the meantime, we can't
have you near patients,

313
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,520
so just go home, put your feet up
and binge a miniseries, whatever.

314
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,960
No one could have known
what'd happen next.

315
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,200
Authorities are expected to confirm

316
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,440
the body is that of missing WNL
weather reporter Denise Stockley.

317
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,840
Certainly a major police
presence there, as we can see.

318
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,480
Let's take a look at the timeline...

319
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,763
Dawson was home alone 24/7,

320
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:47,320
climbing the walls. Withdrawal, I guess.

321
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,200
She was last seen the evening
of Friday, September 15th...

322
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,960
He didn't have patients
to leech pain off anymore.

323
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,560
So he started inflicting
it... on himself.

324
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,440
... for her safe return,

325
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,560
or for any information from witnesses...

326
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,040
Spent a week just
whittling away at himself.

327
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,800
Cut here, a gouge there.

328
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,240
I mean, the guy was a doctor.

329
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
He knew how far he could
go without it getting fatal.

330
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,160
But it was never enough.

331
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,360
None of it was enough.

332
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,560
When he worked on himself, there
was a crucial ingredient missing.

333
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,080
Fear.

334
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,240
The amygdala.

335
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,480
Little almond-shaped
nubbin in your brain.

336
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,370
When you're afraid, it lights
up like a midnight airstrike,

337
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,671
sharpens the senses.

338
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,365
The fear the patient feels

339
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:35,040
when they're staring up
at that ceiling light,

340
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,840
the fear accompanying
each sudden jab of agony,

341
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,880
he'd come to appreciate that, too.

342
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,680
It went with the pain.

343
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,720
Complemented it, like
red wine and steak.

344
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,640
You can inflict pain on
yourself, but not terror.

345
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,240
For that, you need a volunteer.

346
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,200
Dawson was practically
coming when they found him.

347
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,000
He'd enjoyed one big old speedball
of fear and pain and death.

348
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,640
Tell me they put him in jail.

349
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,440
In the hospital.

350
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,200
He wound up in a vegetative state.

351
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Good.

352
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,440
Still there to this day.

353
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,080
In a coma, deep as the ocean.

354
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,160
But the thing of it is, they say
he still has that look on his face.

355
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,760
Blissed out.

356
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,000
Still riding that high.

357
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,000
- You're fucking with me, right?
- OK, I added the boner. I couldn't resist.

358
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,480
- Fun story, huh?
- Yep, fun story.

359
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Ooh!

360
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Oh, man.

361
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,720
Do you want some water?

362
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
- Really, I'm fine.
- No, man, it's no bother.

363
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Thank you kindly.

364
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,240
So, how come you
didn't stay in med tech?

365
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,880
Well, I did for a while.

366
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,920
Just 'cause Dawson went la-la,
neuro research didn't stop.

367
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,960
TCKR adapted it and fine-tuned it.

368
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,480
It's how they wound up with the
digital consciousness transference,

369
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,200
what they call cookies today.

370
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,640
Uh, like when they upload
old people to the cloud?

371
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,520
Yeah, but this was way before that.

372
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,000
We didn't have that whole immersive
VR environment shizzle back then.

373
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,200
What we dealt with was
more organic, almost lo-fi.

374
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
How so?

375
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,000
Gotta say you ask more
questions than the average bear.

376
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,360
Well, to be honest, my car's still
charging, so I've got a bit of time.

377
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,480
Well, then, what I
wanted to show you, um...

378
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,560
Part of what I was working on...

379
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,200
It's, um... cute?

380
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,320
Actually, one of the saddest
things in the whole place.

381
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Doesn't look it.

382
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,560
You ever had one of those relationships

383
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,360
where you just can't get
someone out of your head?

384
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,040
- Yeah.
- Some years back, boy meets girl.

385
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,520
Boy's called Jack, girl's called...

386
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
- Jill.
- Carrie.

387
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Ugh.

388
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Cupcake?

389
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

390
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,560
- Hee-ha!
- ♪ Spread your love like a fever ♪

391
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,360
♪ And don't you ever come down ♪

392
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,360
- Are you the sheriff now?
- Yeah.

393
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,480
- And I'm the prisoner?
- You're in trouble, sir.

394
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,000
- ♪ Spread my love like a fever ♪
- Come and arrest me.

395
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,800
♪ I ain't ever coming down ♪

396
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,760
Eventually, he dick-pukes a
little baby paste up her wazoo,

397
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,160
which takes hold.

398
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,360
- Before you know it, out pops a boy.

399
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Parker.

400
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,640
Boom. They're a family unit.

401
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,240
A walking commercial for a
sunnier future. Happy as hell.

402
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,920
I wanna... I wanna take a photo.

403
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,720
OK. I'm gonna get the
lake in the background.

404
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,880
- All right, buddy.
- OK, you ready?

405
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,120
Parker.

406
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,080
Wave to Mommy. Say
hello. Say hi to Mommy.

407
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,840
Carrie gets hit by a truck.

408
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,760
Winds up at St. Juniper's.

409
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,680
Come back to me.

410
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,000
Come back.

411
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,440
Years go by.

412
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
Jack visits her every
week, talks to her,

413
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,520
plays her recordings of
their son, shoots the shit.

414
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,920
She never wakes up.

415
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,880
But they tested the comm box on her.

416
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,240
A kind of basic device that let
coma folks sort of respond back.

417
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,640
I got you some room fresheners.
You want pine forest?

418
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,080
OK.

419
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,080
What about citrus fresh?

420
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Gotcha.

421
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
And I recorded Parker
singing with some other kids.

422
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,960
Uh, you wanna hear it?

423
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,480
♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪

424
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,200
♪ How I wonder what you are ♪

425
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Hey.

426
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,720
- Hey.
- The woman in 302, Carrie Lamasse.

427
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,960
You're the partner, right?

428
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,160
- Uh-huh.
- Jack?

429
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,760
Rolo Haynes. I represent
neuro R&D for TCKR.

430
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
OK.

431
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,643
We're working on a project
that might be of interest

432
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:20,120
to someone in your position.

433
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,640
What's... What's my position?

434
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,960
We're exploring something that
could give the likes of Carrie

435
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,840
a whole new lease of life.

436
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm talking miraculous.

437
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,560
What do you mean?

438
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,400
So the guys at TCKR have been working

439
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,480
on digitally extracting a
consciousness out of one brain

440
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,640
and kind of rehousing
it in a host brain.

441
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,760
- What does that even mean?
- OK.

442
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,480
So, even on a good day, we only
use 40% of our brain capacity.

443
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,640
There is this whole
other 60% of our noggin

444
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
hanging around like an empty Airbnb.

445
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
And so... ?

446
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,760
And so with our new
compression technique,

447
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,060
we figure we can fit

448
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:04,640
another whole consciousness
into that unused space.

449
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,560
I'm talking about taking Carrie's
consciousness from that broken shell

450
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,680
and putting it in there.

451
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,520
What? Um... Like a voice inside my head?

452
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,200
Like the whole of her inside your head.

453
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,680
Like a hitchhiker. Like a passenger.

454
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,720
Vicarious sensations.
She sees what you see.

455
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
She feels what you feel.

456
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,800
She can live again.

457
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,600
- "Feels" as in... ?
- You got a little boy. Parker.

458
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,640
- How do you know all this?
- You hug Parker and Carrie feels it too.

459
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,640
She can hug your son via you.

460
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,840
How much does this all cost?

461
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,480
Won't cost a thing.

462
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,909
We will have to euthanize
her physical body

463
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,120
during the transfer process,

464
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,400
but we would earmark her
organs for transplants.

465
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,520
Giving back to the community.

466
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,640
So what do you say?

467
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,720
I'd have to think about it.

468
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,680
Carrie's done her thinking.

469
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,240
How about you?

470
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,000
Commencing upload procedure.

471
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,360
Now moving to download.

472
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,200
OK, she's installed.

473
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
She's home.

474
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,480
You can open
your eyes now, Jack.

475
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,520
Carrie?

476
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,440
If you can hear me,
tell Jack what you see.

477
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,560
An... An apple. I... I see an apple.

478
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,560
I can hear her.

479
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,320
- Apple. Apple. She's saying apple.
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,280
Hey, baby.

481
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,040
Hey, Jack.

482
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,480
Take it.

483
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Grip it.

484
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,560
Carrie, you feel that?

485
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,640
Uh-huh. She says she feels it.

486
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,520
Sensations looking good. Take a bite.

487
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, God.

488
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,680
So long since I tasted anything.

489
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,480
You can taste that?

490
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,840
She tastes it. Holy shit.

491
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,800
Looks like you're all set.

492
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,200
- Shall we bring him in?
- Come on in, honey.

493
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,640
Is that Parker?

494
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,480
He got so big.

495
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,400
Oh, God, Jack, hold
him. Hold our little boy.

496
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Give me a really big hug, please.

497
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,640
I feel him. I really feel him.

498
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Mommy says she loves you.

499
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,160
Truly heartwarming.

500
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,800
Yeah. But this is where you say "but."

501
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,960
Well, not to wax philosophical, but...

502
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,520
how long can happiness
realistically last anyhow?

503
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,040
Aah, turn the page already.

504
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,760
Man, you read slow.

505
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,360
I like to take in the pictures.

506
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,680
That's what the graphic
part of a graphic novel is.

507
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,440
It's true.

508
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,480
Hey, uh, I gotta take a piss.

509
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,960
Uh... Ugh.

510
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,680
I'll never get used to this.

511
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,560
Feels good, huh?

512
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,160
- Whoa. You're not washing our hands?
- Uh...

513
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,040
Our hands?

514
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,600
Seriously, though, it's kind of gross.

515
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,800
 38-year-old Clayton
Leigh was today found guilty

516
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,360
of the horrific murder of WNL
weather reporter Denise Stockley,

517
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,560
whose mutilated remains were
discovered one year ago today.

518
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,440
We should turn this off. It's
disturbing to a four-year-old.

519
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,760
He's fine. He's
not even listening.

520
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,360
Parker! Jesus.

521
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,880
- Don't snap at him.
- Oh, but snapping at me is fine?

522
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,680
- Baby, you're...
- How does that work?

523
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,120
He's a child.

524
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,680
This is serious, man. Wha...

525
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,560
No, no, I'm not being...
I'm not being unreasonable.

526
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,240
No, just wait. No.
Just... Just hear me out.

527
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,280
Having a back-seat driver
glued into the back seat

528
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,000
ain't no fun for anyone in the car.

529
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,920
No privacy for him. No agency for her.

530
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,280
- It'd drive you mental.
- Exactly.

531
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,440
You know, fine, forget it.

532
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,040
All right, go ahead. Keep talking.
I'm going for the anchovies.

533
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,520
You gonna be quiet?

534
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,520
Hmm?

535
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,840
You wanna shut up now? You're good? Hmm?

536
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
You...

537
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Fuck you.

538
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,920
Ah!

539
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
Fuck.

540
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,080
Yeah. I don't... I don't care.

541
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,560
Oh, you... you're still talking.

542
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,440
Hmm? You... Hmm? Oh.

543
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,160
Anyhow, soon he or they come to me.

544
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,080
Like I'm their relationship therapist.

545
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh, would you pipe
down and let me speak?

546
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,040
Let me finish a goddamn sentence.

547
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,200
Hey, guys, I see the problem.

548
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
She's the problem.

549
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,320
Familiarity breeding
contempt is the problem.

550
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,520
You need to ration your contact.

551
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,190
Ration how? She's
running through my head

552
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:55,760
like a goddamn tune I can't shake.

553
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,880
Well, we could upgrade
your privileges, Jack.

554
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,960
Give you a little more control.

555
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,720
Shut up! Sorry. Go on.

556
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,920
Well, maybe if you had the ability

557
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,120
to place Carrie on pause now and then...

558
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,000
it'd make things easier
for the both of you.

559
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Do it.

560
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,200
Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Do it.

561
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,760
 So he upped his privileges.

562
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
- Should be able to put her on pause.
- This one?

563
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,960
- That's it.
- OK.

564
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Didn't take him long to use 'em.

565
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,080
So now we're just openly
checking out women's racks?

566
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,446
And don't say you weren't

567
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,400
because I can feel the
fucking boner forming, OK?

568
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,280
And he checks her ass too
as she leaves. Holy fuck.

569
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,200
So I checked her out. What?

570
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,480
I'm horny as fuck, haven't
jerked off in, like, a month.

571
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,360
Well, I'm not stopping you.

572
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,840
You're looking over my
shoulder but from the inside.

573
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,840
It's like trying to jerk off in
front of a cop who's also your mom.

574
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,760
- Fuck you!
- OK, you know what?

575
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,520
That's it. That's it. That's it.
Time out. I'm putting you on pause.

576
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,880
No. Jack, don't you dare.

577
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,600
Jack. Jack, I'm warning you.

578
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
Not cool.

579
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,880
Don't do that again.

580
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,080
Are... Are we at home?

581
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,120
Why the Halloween pumpkin?

582
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,760
Halloween's months from now.

583
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Actually, it's today.

584
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,000
How long was I on pause?

585
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,040
Uh, just a few weeks.

586
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,320
I don't know. Eight?

587
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,480
OK, I know. I'm... I'm sorry.

588
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,600
I know. I'm sorry. I felt really bad.

589
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,480
So, um, I got you this.

590
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,880
Figured it's kind of
our anniversary, so...

591
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,440
Fuck you. You're a fucking asshole.

592
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,600
You want me to eat this cupcake
or not? Orange cream icing.

593
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,080
- Where's Parker?
- Your favorite.

594
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,840
I wanna see Parker. You had
him away from me for months.

595
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,920
I wanna see my boy.

596
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
OK.

597
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
OK.

598
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,320
Where is he?

599
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Hey.

600
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,720
What you got going on there?

601
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,400
- Is that a fire truck?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,120
Tell him I love him.

603
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,400
Hey, buddy, Mommy loves you.

604
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
What?

605
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,320
- Tell him I need a hug.
- You wanna know something else?

606
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,720
Mommy needs a hug. Hmm?

607
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,240
Oh, God!

608
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,040
 Parker complicated things.

609
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,920
They both felt responsibility for
him, so they tried to compromise,

610
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,920
you know, reach an
agreement, like adults.

611
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,200
Jack put Carrie on pause
except for the weekends,

612
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,360
when they'd take Parker out
with Carrie in attendance,

613
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,400
kind of like a divorcée
with visiting rights.

614
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,200
You go hide.

615
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,800
That's it!

616
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,080
You tricked me.

617
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,320
Aah!

618
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,840
- OK.
- Come down here.

619
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
I'm coming.

620
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,840
 It worked OK.

621
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,360
For a while.

622
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Hey.

623
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,560
Looks like we're neighbors.

624
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,880
- I've just moved in.
- Uh...

625
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,200
- Emily.
- Jack. Nice to meet you.

626
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,240
Oh, please.

627
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Hey.

628
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,840
Oh!

629
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,160
- Who's this?
- It's Parker.

630
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,360
Cool name.

631
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,760
Guess I'll see you around.

632
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Yeah.

633
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,520
Guess I'll see you around.

634
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,280
She was nice, OK?

635
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Oh, cut the shit. I know
when your hormones are flowing, OK?

636
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,600
Our balls are brewing up
a blow load as we speak.

637
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
I can't. I'm with our son.

638
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,680
I didn't hit on anyone.

639
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,800
You know what? Fuck it.
Visiting time is over.

640
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,520
No. Jack, don't you dare. Jack.

641
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,880
Jack, you son of a bi...

642
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,840
Parker, wait up.

643
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,880
Anyhow, as time passed by, Jack
got it on with the neighbor.

644
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,440
And Carrie didn't take it so good.

645
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,280
She works all week. We just
wanted to spend a weekend together.

646
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,320
Jesus, can't you just be happy for us?

647
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,200
No, Jack, weirdly enough, I can't.

648
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,680
Christ, you are so bitter.

649
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,720
No. Why?

650
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,560
- Is she giving you shit?
- Mnh-mnh.

651
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,360
Carrie, stop giving him shit.

652
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,600
Tell her to back off.

653
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,160
- I...
- Tell her.

654
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,960
Jesus Christ.

655
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,880
So the weekend thing isn't working.

656
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,600
And we tried limiting her to an hour...

657
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,760
But you can tell that she's in
there, like that judging and bitching.

658
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,000
The time frame is
frustrating for Carrie.

659
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,360
Carrie is frustrating for us.

660
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,360
You got Carrie on pause now?

661
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,160
OK, well...

662
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,800
there's always deletion.

663
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,400
- As in... ?
- As in permanent erasure.

664
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,840
- Uh-huh.
- No.

665
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,840
- That'd... That'd be killing her.
- Not legally.

666
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,120
But ethically.

667
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,320
Please. She is just some
leftover code in your head.

668
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,280
It'll be like... like deleting an email.

669
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,360
No.

670
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,680
No. No deletion. I'm not doing it.

671
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,600
She wants to be near Parker. I
can't take that away from her.

672
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,600
There's gotta be something you can do.

673
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,920
My friends...

674
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,200
you're in luck.

675
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,360
It's something we're beta testing.

676
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,480
It's actually aimed at
terminally ill parents.

677
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,720
Kind of like a souvenir for their kids.

678
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,560
Here.

679
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,680
A monkey?

680
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,320
More like a keepsake.

681
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,200
We can put her in here.

682
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,480
In there?

683
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,160
Uh-huh. It's...

684
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,840
It has a consciousness receptor,

685
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,560
kind of like the one we put
in your head, but a prototype.

686
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,320
And there's a camera here
so she can see Parker.

687
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Plus the whole body's
got haptic feedback,

688
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,040
so if little Parkie gives
it a cuddle, she'll feel it.

689
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,280
And she can communicate back,

690
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,960
but in a kid-friendly, controlled way.

691
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,360
Yeah, I don't know. I'm
gonna have to think about it.

692
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,960
I say yes.

693
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,440
Well, she's done her
thinking. How about you?

694
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,400
The transfer went pretty fast.

695
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,560
Carrie wouldn't have even
been aware it was happening.

696
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Till she woke up.

697
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,800
Come on, buddy, you gotta
tear it. Tear into that thing.

698
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,160
- Jack?
- You almost got it.

699
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,840
There you go.

700
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,400
All right, pull it out.

701
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,960
Oh. There you go.

702
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,880
What is it, Parker?

703
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,400
Monkey.

704
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
What?

705
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,400
That's pretty cool, huh?

706
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,400
Jack. Jack, what the fuck?

707
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,360
But you know something?

708
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,080
This... This, uh... This
is a very special monkey.

709
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,320
- Mom wanted you to have it.
- What?

710
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,040
Every time you hug it, Mom will
know, and she'll feel that hug too.

711
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,640
No. No, no, Jack, Jack, put
me back in your fucking head.

712
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,760
Jack!

713
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,000
And this monkey can speak to you.

714
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,200
It can let you know how it feels.

715
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,440
How did she speak?

716
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,120
Well, the comm setup
was a little rudimentary.

717
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,520
I mean, this is a prototype.

718
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,360
Jack!

719
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
No.

720
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,040
 Monkey loves you.

721
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
What was that?

722
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,520
 Monkey needs a hug.

723
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,280
Give monkey a hug.

724
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,600
Monkey loves you.

725
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,280
Monkey needs a hug. Monkey
loves you. Monkey loves you.

726
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,320
Monkey loves you. Monkey...
Monkey... Monkey needs a hug.

727
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,920
- Yeah, I think...
- Monkey loves you.

728
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,680
Monkey... Monkey needs a hug.

729
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,840
Monkey just needs a minute to get
used to how things are gonna be.

730
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,920
Now, listen, you fucking bitch.

731
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,200
We can still have you wiped.

732
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,920
That what you want?

733
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,120
Do "monkey needs a hug" for no.

734
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,000
Monkey needs a hug.

735
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,640
Are you gonna be a good toy?

736
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,240
Are you gonna be a good toy?

737
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,760
Monkey loves you.

738
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,320
You better.

739
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,520
 Anyhow, in the end,
Parker got tired of his new toy.

740
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,400
But that's kids.

741
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
They're ingrates.

742
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Monkey needs a hug.

743
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Whoa.

744
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,720
Wait, so this is a crime museum.

745
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,200
- Where's the crime in this?
- Well, the monkey is the crime.

746
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,880
See, a couple of years back,

747
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,000
the UN made it illegal

748
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,240
to transfer human consciousnesses
into limited formats like this.

749
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,560
Gotta be able to express

750
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:30,440
at least five emotions for
it to be humane, apparently.

751
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,480
Human rights for cookies. Right, Carrie?

752
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,560
Monkey needs a hug.

753
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,480
She's still in there?

754
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,920
It'd be illegal to
delete her too, so, yeah.

755
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,600
Go figure.

756
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,000
Anyhow, ACLU raised one heck of a stink,

757
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,480
and so thanks to this son of a
monkey, I was out on my ass from TCKR.

758
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,400
Not even a severance package.

759
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,200
It's why I started this place.

760
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,200
Had to branch out somehow, and it
appealed to the carny in me, I guess.

761
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,760
Monkey needs a hug.

762
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,880
Goddamn AC's still not
working. Ooh, it's hot.

763
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,360
But I've kept you waiting too long.

764
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,480
You ready for the prime
exhibit? Step right this way.

765
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:27,520
Listen, I gotta warn you, he's
not the man he once...

766
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,480
... was.

767
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,760
- Sorry.
- Do you want some more water?

768
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,360
I'm fine.

769
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,600
He's this way.

770
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Ooh.

771
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,760
Come on, mister! You got a visitor.

772
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,520
May I present Clayton Leigh,
weather girl killer.

773
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,840
I know, he's kind of mopey these days.

774
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,440
Cuts kind of a pathetic figure.

775
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,920
But don't feel too sorry for him.

776
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,960
He is a convicted murderer.

777
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Lest we forget Denise Stockley.

778
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,480
Tragic and cute.

779
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Ain't that right, Clayton?

780
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,040
Coo-ee!

781
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,560
He's actually looking at you.

782
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,160
Look out. Maybe you're his type.

783
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,160
He looks so real.

784
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,480
Well, it is him, or a
fully conscious upload of him.

785
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,640
You're probably wondering
how he got in here.

786
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,890
After TCKR kicked me out,

787
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:43,280
my plan was to branch out
into celebrity consciousnesses,

788
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,675
sign up famous people
and reincarnate them

789
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,000
as holograms after they die.

790
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,960
Kind of like a living Madame Tussauds.

791
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,800
But celebrities, that's just a quagmire.

792
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,720
Too many rights issues,
asshole representatives.

793
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,600
But convicted killers?

794
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,040
It's a different story.

795
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,760
Mr. Leigh, allow me to introduce myself.

796
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,680
- My name is Rolo Haynes.
- They say you're in technology.

797
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,040
- Uh, yes, that is true.
- So you can look into this DNA thing?

798
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,640
Prove it wasn't me?

799
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,920
Um, yes, that's certainly a
possibility, but that's not why I'm here.

800
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,760
- I have a proposal.
- Goodbye.

801
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,280
No, wait. I have a proposal. I can help.

802
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,280
I can help your family.

803
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,640
How'd you talk him into it?

804
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,840
He didn't need much convincing.

805
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,560
So really it's just signing over
the rights to your digital self

806
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,600
in case the worst happens,

807
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,251
and I promise your
relatives will receive

808
00:52:12,252 --> 00:52:13,640
the lion's share of any profits.

809
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,960
So if, you know, God forbid,

810
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,800
you do get sent to the chair,

811
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,160
you know your family will
be provided for, for life.

812
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,200
- How'd his family feel about it?
- They didn't give a shit.

813
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,840
Abandoned him the
moment he got locked up.

814
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,160
I know, right?

815
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,480
- Jesus Christ, Clay, it's your soul.
- Ain't no such thing.

816
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,680
It's just a computer
simulation or somethin'.

817
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,120
Then why does he need your permission?

818
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,560
If my pardon comes
through, it won't matter.

819
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,560
And if it doesn't?

820
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,960
Then if they send me to the
chair, this is gonna pay.

821
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,090
It's gonna keep you and
the kids above water,

822
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,800
maintain a roof over y'all.

823
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,000
Baby, don't.

824
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,120
This could be a good thing.

825
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,280
But he never did get that pardon.

826
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,880
Shit, no, 'cause he was guilty.

827
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,800
But wasn't there some doubt?
You know, that documentary?

828
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,800
Fake news. Hatchet job.

829
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,000
- What about the DNA tampering?
- Seriously?

830
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,120
There's no doubt about it.

831
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,080
The day he got the chair

832
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,440
was a great day for justice.

833
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,480
Clayton couldn't complain.

834
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,400
I mean, he was gonna be a pioneer.

835
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,000
I was gonna slurp up his
entire consciousness.

836
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,560
He'd be the first guy on death
row to survive his own execution.

837
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,640
The transfer went beautifully.

838
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,080
Before I knew it,
Clayton was born again.

839
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,160
Hi, buddy.

840
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,800
Congratulations to you.

841
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,960
You're in the afterlife, so to speak.

842
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,080
Looking good.

843
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,560
Am I a ghost?

844
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,520
If that helps, yeah.

845
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,160
I just gotta test a few things here, OK?

846
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,560
So this may seem a little
weird. Just hang on in there.

847
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,840
What the fuck?

848
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,280
See, I knew just seeing the guy
walking around captive, that was good,

849
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,360
but that wasn't much of a draw.

850
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,480
But pulling the lever yourself?

851
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,560
Now, that's an attraction.

852
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,440
- Hey!
- OK.

853
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,640
- Hey!
- Three, two, one.

854
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,280
Dawson's pain tech had
paved the way for it.

855
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,840
A perfect re-creation

856
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,800
of exactly how the agony
of electrocution feels.

857
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,000
Every volt simulated for real.

858
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,720
Key was, never let him exceed
15 seconds at max voltage.

859
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,560
That would wipe his digital
synapses out for good, kill him.

860
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,680
Ten seconds seemed to be
the optimum shock length,

861
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,600
so that became the intractable limit.

862
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,560
OK. Have a little rest.

863
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,480
Get used to your room.

864
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,200
Official opening's tomorrow.

865
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,240
 In fact, in the early days,
the problem was fitting everyone in.

866
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,800
Please don't do it. Please, please,
please, please, please. Please.

867
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,080
Please don't do it. Please.

868
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,280
But, of course, it was really the
souvenirs that were driving trade.

869
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,760
It was beautiful.

870
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,880
- Every time you finished juicing him,

871
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,880
out pops a conscious
sentient snapshot of Clayton,

872
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,880
not a recording, a true copy of his mind

873
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,680
perpetually experiencing
that beautiful pain.

874
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,400
Stuck forever in that one
perfect moment of agony.

875
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,920
Always on.

876
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,160
Always suffering.

877
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,800
- And what you'd call...

878
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,920
fun size.

879
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,120
Take a
seat if it makes it easier.

880
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,960
Sit down.

881
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,360
What? My accent?

882
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,400
Not fucking British.

883
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,520
Sorry to disappoint.

884
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,160
Who are you?

885
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,560
You left some parts of the story
out, Mr. Haynes. Why is that?

886
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,760
You forgot to mention the protests.

887
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,880
His wife started a campaign,
got some momentum behind it.

888
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,520
Guess you'd call it
virtue-signaling bullshit,

889
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,560
but I know it hurt your attendance.

890
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,400
And even the protesters
got bored after a while.

891
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,800
As soon as it was clear the state

892
00:58:57,803 --> 00:58:59,941
wouldn't do a damn
thing about clearing him,

893
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,760
they just moved onto the next
viral miscarriage of justice

894
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,840
they can hang a hashtag off of.

895
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,040
But they did their job, right?
This place was on the shit list.

896
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,640
Who was your core clientele after that?

897
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,293
You lost the day trippers,

898
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:18,600
the tourists, fun family
crowd. Who was left?

899
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,680
You again, you pasty-faced motherfucker?

900
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,760
 Loners. Sadists.

901
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,680
The supremacist sicko demographic.

902
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,040
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. Out, out, out.

903
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And that crowd's not big enough.

904
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,960
They don't keep the lights on.

905
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,720
So if someone shows up,

906
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,400
some classic race-hate rich
guy with a hard-on for power...

907
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,280
and he slips you some extra for
a longer time at the crank...

908
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,480
... you take it.

909
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,120
Thank you.

910
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,400
 Wasn't the same
after that, was he?

911
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,280
Not dead but hardly alive either.

912
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,640
Even the perverts didn't wanna
pull a... a lever on a vegetable.

913
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,280
Where's the joy in that?

914
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,480
But someone came to see him, right?

915
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,240
She saw him.

916
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,400
She stood on this spot.

917
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,480
Saw what you had done to him.

918
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,440
Clay?

919
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,520
 He was like a docile animal.

920
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,520
God knows if he even recognized her.

921
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,920
God knows if he even recognizes me.

922
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,960
Dad.

923
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,640
Happy birthday.

924
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,280
What my mom saw that day was
more than she could take.

925
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,560
She had hoped during the whole fight

926
01:02:01,561 --> 01:02:03,591
to clear his name, but that broke her.

927
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,120
You know what she did
when she came home?

928
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,960
Bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka.

929
01:02:07,961 --> 01:02:10,440
I found her. You fucking piece of shit.

930
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,440
Whoa.

931
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,680
Is it hot?

932
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,520
It's humid, right? I'm sorry.

933
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,280
Stupid digital AC.

934
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
Easy to hack.

935
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,200
Never accept drinks from strangers.

936
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,640
My daddy taught me that.

937
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,040
Going by the color of your lips,
you're gonna be gone in 30 seconds.

938
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,400
Hey, don't worry.

939
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,320
We're gonna see you on the other side.

940
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,200
Hey.

941
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,280
Computer says you're awake.

942
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,360
Congratulations. You're a pioneer.

943
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,840
What the fuck did you do?

944
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,840
It turns out that it is possible

945
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,200
to transfer a fresh consciousness
inside a virtual one.

946
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,160
My daddy's giving you a ride.

947
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,600
Get me out of here, you fucking cun...

948
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,235
I'm guessing you're screaming
and calling me names right now,

949
01:03:38,236 --> 01:03:40,960
but I wouldn't know.

950
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,880
- You...
- I mean, my dad can't talk, thanks to you.

951
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,960
Otherwise I'm guessing he'd
pass on your goodwill messages.

952
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,640
You fu... You fucking
bitch! You fucking bitch!

953
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,440
In other news, you'll shortly
be undertaking another first.

954
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,520
The first double-decker mercy killing.

955
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,200
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

956
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,440
I took off the ten-second limit so
Daddy'll get a full hit of juice.

957
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,920
Should be enough to set him free.

958
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,640
You... however...

959
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,520
burrowed away inside there,
Mr. Haynes, you'll feel it all.

960
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,080
- Hey!
- All the pain.

961
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,240
- Fuck y...
- Every perfect little shot of it.

962
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,200
- Fuck you!
- I'm getting myself a souvenir, too.

963
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

964
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,720
Hey, please, please. I...

965
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,240
Always on.

966
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,040
- Always suffering.
- Fuck! No, no, no.

967
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,280
Bye, Daddy.

968
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,760
- Monkey loves you.
- Shh.

969
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,040
How'd I do, Mom?

970
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,640
All good?

971
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,920
Just great, honey.

972
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,760
I'm proud of you.

973
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,880
Aw, thanks.
