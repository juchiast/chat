It's a thief, that thing.
What are you doing?

48
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:57,571
Just sharing that.

49
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,571
I thought people might find
it funny.

50
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:07,171
It's not funny. It's sweet.

51
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:10,531
Trust me, that day wasn't sweet.

52
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:14,531
We'd gone to a safari park.
First family outing after Jack died.

53
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:19,811
There was monkeys all over the car
and no-one saying anything.

54
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,811
Mum drove home, that was a first.
When I came down the next morning,

55
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:30,571
all Jack's photos were gone from that
wall.

56
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,571
She put them in the attic.

57
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,131
That's how she dealt with stuff.

58
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:38,931
And then when Dad died,
up went his photos.

59
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,371
She just left this one here.

60
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:44,051
Her only boy,
giving her a fake smile.

61
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,731
She didn't know it was fake.

62
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:50,731
Maybe that makes it worse.

63
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:59,331
Oh... Oh, shit...

64
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:03,331
Oh, shit...

65
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,171
Sorry.

66
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:11,171
It's OK.

67
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,411
- Do you want me to...?
- No, it's all right.

68
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:19,051
I don't mind.

69
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:23,051
I am knackered though...so...

70
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,131
Don't worry.

71
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:27,771
Sure?

72
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:31,571
I'm sure.

73
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:36,371
- I love you.
- Love you too.

74
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,331
Hey, get dressed.

75
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:59,211
Van's got to be back by two or
they'll do us for an extra day.

76
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:03,211
Job's just come in. Needs to be
done by the end of play today.

77
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,691
All right.

78
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,651
It is a full page.

79
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:10,171
No, no, it's fine.

80
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:14,171
I'll drive all the way there
alone...

81
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:20,131
..pick the car up alone...
drive all the way back alone...

82
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,451
I have to make my own lunch...

83
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,451
Oh, stop it,
you're breaking my heart.

84
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:32,771
Bye-bye.

85

'Hi, this is Ash. I'm too busy or
lazy to answer,

00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:08,371

so...'

94
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,331
They're closed now,
no point calling back,

95
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,571
and his just goes straight to
messages.

96
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,211
Those batteries are a joke.

97
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,731
He'll be on his way.
He's probably just...

98
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,971
I'm just scared something's
happened to him.

99
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,131
Nothing's happened.

100
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,731
But something could've happened.

101
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,531
Look, sweetheart,
nothing's happened,

102
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:38,531
you're just working yourself up,
imagining the worst possible thing,

103
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:42,531
and it's just, he's probably
stuck somewhere with no reception.

104
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:18,771
Hey. Hey.

105
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:23,371
It's not real, is it?

106
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:27,371
At Mark's wake,
I sat there thinking it's not real.

107
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:31,491
The people didn't look real,
their voices weren't real.

108
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:34,331
It's like you're out on a spacewalk
and no-one can...

109
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:38,331
Sarah.

110
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,851
I can sign you up to something that
helps.

111
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:53,211
It helped me.

112
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,011
It will let you speak to him.

113
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:59,291
I know he's dead,
but it wouldn't work if he wasn't.

114
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,171
And don't worry,
it's not some crazy spiritual thing.

115
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:04,731
- He was a heavy user, he'd be perfect...
- Please shut up.

116
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:07,011
I mean, it's still in beta,
but I've got an invite...

117
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:08,051
Please shut up.

118
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:09,291
You won't have to do anything,
I'll just sign you up...

119
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:13,291
SHUT UP!

120
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:17,651
Hey, are you all right?

121
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,191
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,317
I don't care what it is,
I don't want it!

123
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,816
It's obscene to use his name.
His name, for God's sake!

124
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,696
It hurts, you know it hurts.

125
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,776
Which is why I signed you up.

126
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:03,416
What is it? W-What is it?

127
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,216
You click the link
and you talk to it.

128
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:07,874
You talk to it?

129
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,274
You type messages in, like an e-mail,

130
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:12,674
and then it talks back to you,
just like he would.

131
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,029
He's dead.

132
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:15,869
It's software. It mimics him.

133
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,989
You give it someone's name.

134
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:21,469
It goes back and reads through all
the things they've ever said online,

135
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:25,469
their Facebook updates,
their Tweets, anything public.

136
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,189
I just gave it Ash's name.
The system did the rest.

137
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:30,469
It's so clever.

138
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,089
It's...sick. It's sick!

139
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:35,722
Just say hello to it.
If you like it,

140
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,162
you then give it access
to his private emails.

141
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:41,802
The more it has, the more it's him.

142
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,842
It won't be...

143
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:47,842
No, it's not, but it helps.

144
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:45,962
Listen, Nay, it's me. Hi.
Uh, I really need to speak to you.

145
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:53,442
Um, can you please call me
as soon as you get this?

146
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,122
Hi!

147
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:19,122
I'm so sorry.
I just got your message.
What's wrong? what happened?

148
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:21,202
'Mar?'

149
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:22,722
Mar, are you OK?

150
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:26,722
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I just, I
just... I had a bad one earlier.

151
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:30,042
D'you want me to come and visit?
I'm going to come and visit.

152
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,482
'No, it's OK, really, I'm...'

153
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:32,922
Mar, you're upset.
I'm going to come and see you.

154
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:35,842
No. No, don't.

155
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:39,842
I'm OK. I promise you I'm OK.

156
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,322
'I've got to go,
I've got a deadline.'

157
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:42,882
Are you sure?

158
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:46,482
It's a tight deadline, got to
be in by dawn, so...I'd better go.

159
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:47,602
Well, if you have...

160
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:51,602
Bye, Nay.

161
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:31,882
Hello, I've locked myself
out of the house again.

162
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:39,562
Wait, where are you going?

163
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:43,082
Hello. I'm no good at birthday
presents.

164
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:47,082
♪ I love you... ♪

165
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:09,122
Hello?

166
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:11,822
'So...'

167
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:16,002
'..how am I sounding?'

168
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,762
'Hello?'

169
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:21,762
Hello! You sound just like him.

170
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,482
'Almost creepy isn't it?

171
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,602
'I say creepy,

172
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:29,602
'I mean, it's totally batshit crazy
I can even talk to you.

173
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:32,682
'I mean, I don't even have a mouth.'

174
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:36,602
That's...that's just...

175
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:39,522
'Just what?'

176
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:42,922
That's just the sort of thing
that he would say.

177
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,922
'Well, that's why I said it.'

178
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,722
I think I'm going mad.

179
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:57,722
'I won't tell anyone if you don't.'

180
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,002
'You're not crying, are you?'

181
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,042
Sorry.

182
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:09,042
You always said that
I looked weird when I cried.

183
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:14,642
'Did I?
I sound like a right sick fuck.'

184
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:19,442
Yeah, you were. You were.

185
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:22,882
'But in a good way?'

186
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:26,882
Yeah. Yeah. In a good way.

187
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:36,562
So I went in,
after all your persuasion,

188
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:40,562
and then like straightaway I got a
spine of a sea anemone or something

189
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:45,242
stuck in my foot, and you threw
a jeb thinking it was poisonous.

190
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:47,962
'What's "threw a jeb"?'

191
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:50,962
Oh, it's um, it's a phrase we had,
like throwing a fit.

192
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:53,322
'Oh, OK, so I "threw a jeb".'

193
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:56,842
Yeah, and you were looking
in a guidebook, trying to figure out

194
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,282
if there were any poisonous
sea creatures in Greece,

195
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,442
when this local guy
comes over and says,

196
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,842
"My wife
knows what to do,

197
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:07,842
"come back to my house." Although
he wasn't French, obviously.

198
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:12,522
I used to hate
walking in the country.

199
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,522
'You must be getting old.'

200
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:18,522
Oi.

201
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,162
I remember you brought me up here
when we first met your mum.

202
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:23,762
We'd been at hers all weekend

203
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:27,762
and you could tell
I needed some headspace.

204
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:30,042
You were good like that.

205
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,842
'You speak about me
like I'm not here.'

206
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,162
Sorry.

207
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:37,922
'It's all right.
I mean, I'm not, really.'

208
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,482
Mm.

209
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:44,442
'Show me what it looks like there.'

210
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,642
How?

211
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:49,642
'Use the camera on your phone.'

212
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:53,402
You weren't ever really
impressed with views.

213
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:56,322
When we went to the Grand Canyon,
you said it was just a big gap.

214
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,882
'I Tweeted that, too.'

215
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,322
Yeah, I remember
the roaming charges.

216
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,442
You were overly proud
of that definition.

217
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:04,362
'I was just speaking my mind.'

218
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:07,202
Yeah, well shut up
and cop a load of this.

219
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:10,722
'Yeah. Mainly just green, isn't it?'

220
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:12,802
You told me this was
a famous lover's leap.

221
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:15,602
Doomed couples jumping
to their deaths in Victorian times.

222
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:18,802
I think you just wanted me
to cling to you.

223
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:22,122
'Actually everyone who's ever jumped
from here did it alone. Nice.'

224
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:23,722
Did you just look that up?

225
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:27,722
'Sort of. Shouldn't I have?'

226
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,522
It's a bit weird.

227
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:33,242
'Sorry. I'll only do it again
if you ask.'

228
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:36,602
No, no. No, it's fine.

229
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:41,602
Oh, wait, hang on.

230
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:42,762
'Shall I go?'

231
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:46,762
No, no, no.
I'll call them back later.

232
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,682
I'm going to go and see if I can
make friends with these cows.

233
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:12,122
Just going to record it.

234
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,122
Sure.

235
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:24,882
There you go.

236
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:28,882
It's OK.

237
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:33,442
Wait, hang on, here it is again.

238
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:37,562
'It's so fast, isn't it?'

239
00:22:37,562 --> 00:22:39,722
I know. I know,

240
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:43,322
it's like the speed you'd expect
a bee's heart to go at or something.

241
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:47,322
Wait, hang on.

242
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:51,442
Oh, shit. Shit, shit.

243
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:55,802
Ash? Hello?

244
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:59,802
Ash?

245
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:04,202
Ash? Hello?

246
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:15,002
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

247
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:26,162
I'm sorry!

248
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:27,962
'What happened?'

249
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:31,962
I dropped you. I'm sorry. It was
just... It was... I'm sorry...

250
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:35,962
'Hey, it's all right, I'm fine.
I'm not in that thing, you know,

251
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:38,602
'I'm remote, I'm in the cloud.

252
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,682
'You don't have to worry
about breaking me.'

253
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:43,482
It was just, it was stupid, because
I was so excited about the scan.

254
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:47,362
'Yeah, I kept the sound of that.
Here, listen.'

255
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:56,162
'You were probably matching that
heartbeat, throwing a jeb like that.

256
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:58,922
'It's all fine. Calm down.

257
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,922
'I'm not going anywhere.'

258
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:08,482
You're very fragile.

259
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:12,482
'Yeah. I was going to
talk to you about that, actually.'

260
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:16,762
What do you mean?

261
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:20,762
'There's another level to this
available, so to speak.

262
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:23,642
'Kind of experimental,
and I won't lie, it's not cheap...'

263
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,242
What is it?

264
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:29,256
'Are you sitting down?
This might sound a bit creepy.'

265
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,284
- Morning.
- Morning.

266
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,857
What's this, a block of gold?

267
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:42,398
I wish.

268
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,418
Where's it going, upstairs?

269
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:45,092
Yeah, please.

270
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:46,932
Put your thumb on there.

271
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:49,372
OK.

272
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:52,812
Oh, when you get it up there,
you have to lie it on its back.

273
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:56,812
Thank you.

274
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:38,092
Say something.

275
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:42,092
Let me see.

276
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:57,252
Yeah, well.
Never was much of a looker, was I?

277
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,852
It doesn't look like you.

278
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:05,852
Not yet.
It's blank till you activate it.

279
00:26:07,572 --> 00:26:11,572
Get the bath ready.

280
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:26,772
Mar? Get the bath ready.

281
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,412
What is this?

282
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,372
Hang on, I'll find out.

283
00:26:39,372 --> 00:26:41,372
It's nutrient gel.

284
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:45,052
Stops the synthetic muscle
drying out in transit.

285
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:47,212
Smells almost...

286
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,492
like marshmallow.

287
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:52,892
You can eat it if you like.
It's non-toxic.

288
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:55,292
I'll give that a miss, thanks.

289
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:59,292
Don't forget the electrolytes.

290
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:04,252
OK, right - the whole lot?

291
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:08,252
Mm-hm, the whole lot.

292
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,652
It's like fish food.

293
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:16,652
He likes the taste of it.

294
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:19,092
Better leave him to it.

295
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:23,092
Yeah. Yeah.

296
00:27:24,772 --> 00:27:26,652
I have to go in a minute.

297
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:28,532
Oh, don't leave me here with it!

298
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:31,412
Sorry. Look, you can hear -
it's starting already.

299
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:35,052
Don't switch
the bathroom light on.

300
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:36,612
Don't what?

301
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,772
Don't switch the bathroom light on.

302
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:41,092
Let it brew.

303
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:45,092
Listen, I've got to go...

304
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:19,492
♪ And it's all right

305
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:21,012
♪ It's coming on

306
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:25,012
♪ We got to get right back to
where we started...♪

307
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:21,052
You could've left me some clothes.

308
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:25,532
I mean, talk about an undignified
entrance.

309
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:37,452
That's a bit creepy.
What you're doing.

310
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:43,692
Is there at least a towel?
I'm dripping everywhere.

311
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:49,612
Hello?

312
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:55,492
I won't bite.

313
00:29:57,292 --> 00:30:01,292
I'm all right here for now.

314
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:05,852
Would you like me
to put some food on?

315
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:07,492
Do you eat?

316
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:08,732
No.

317
00:30:08,732 --> 00:30:10,252
I mean, I don't need to.

318
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:12,932
I can chew and swallow,
if that makes it easier?

319
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:16,932
Don't worry about it, it's fine.

320
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:25,692
I need a drink.

321
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:41,532
Are you sure that's...?

322
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:43,532
I know, I'm not supposed to.
It won't kill us.

323
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:44,812
The official advice is...

324
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:48,812
Fuck the official advice.
It's one night.

325
00:30:49,492 --> 00:30:51,252
You look well.

326
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,252
Well, I am young.

327
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:57,252
I mean... You look like him
on a good day.

328
00:30:57,972 --> 00:31:00,972
The photos we keep
tend to be flattering.

329
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:04,972
I guess I wasn't any different.

330
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:22,252
You're so soft.

331
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:26,252
You're so smooth.
How are you so smooth?

332
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:31,172
You've got pores and lines...

333
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:34,332
It's texture-mapping.

334
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:37,852
The really tiny details
are visual - 2D.

335
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:41,852
Here, try my fingertips.

336
00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:47,852
See?

337
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,572
Weird.

338
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:51,852
Does it bother you?

339
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:55,172
No.

340
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:59,172
Yeah.

341
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:03,172
I don't know.

342
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:14,092
I missed you. I missed you so much!

343
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:17,012
Hey, don't cry.

344
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:21,012
Don't cry.

345
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,652
Come on then. Top off.

346
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,332
What's wrong?

347
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:54,172
He had a mole there.

348
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:58,172
Where?

349
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,692
There.

350
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:05,692
Hang on.

351
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:09,932
That's ridiculous.

352
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:13,932
That's completely stupid.

353
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:26,892
Hello?

354
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:28,132
Hi.

355
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:32,132
Your hand's on my tit.

356
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:39,932
You're doing wonders
for my self-esteem here.

357
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:42,812
There's no record of my sexual
response.

358
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,132
I didn't discuss
that side of things online.

359
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:49,132
But you have sexual responses.
I mean...

360
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,892
This works?

361
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:53,292
Oh.

362
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:57,292
That, I can turn that on and off
pretty much instantly.

363
00:33:57,732 --> 00:34:01,732
See?

364
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:09,892
I can do it again if you like.

365
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:21,772
Oh, oh, God. Oh, shit.

366
00:34:21,772 --> 00:34:23,212
Should I stop?

367
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:27,212
No! No, it's really good.

368
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:30,652
Where... Where did you learn this?

369
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,652
Set routine.
Based on pornographic videos.

370
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:59,092
I love you.

371
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:01,193
I love you.

372
00:35:18,478 --> 00:35:19,658
What is it?

373
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:20,886
What were you doing?

374
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,046
Nothing.

375
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:24,766
The way that your eyes were open,
it scared me.

376
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:26,286
You'd prefer if I closed them?

377
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:30,286
What, when you're sleeping?
Um, yeah?

378
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:34,326
I don't really need to sleep.

379
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:38,326
Well, just try, next time.

380
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:51,806
Can I get you anything?

381
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:53,286
No.

382
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:54,846
Coffee, sandwich?

383
00:35:54,846 --> 00:35:57,326
I said no.

384
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,806
Ash.

385
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:02,326
Look, sorry.

386
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,766
It's just a bit odd.

387
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:07,846
I can appreciate
it's pretty strange.

388
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:10,406
I just need a bit of, just,
getting used to it.

389
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:12,726
And I shouldn't have drunk
last night.

390
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:14,446
Next time could you try and stop me?

391
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:15,486
Stop you drinking?

392
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:16,566
Yeah.

393
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:18,846
So I get to enjoy being
a bit of a bastard?

394
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:26,486
What's wrong?

395
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:29,166
Oh, God. Shit, right,
get in the bedroom.

396
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:33,166
What?
Now!

397
00:36:37,286 --> 00:36:38,326
Hey.

398
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:42,326
Hey!

399
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:45,886
Can I come in?

400
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:49,886
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:54,126
Look at you.

402
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:58,046
The town mouse has become
the country mouse.

403
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:59,926
Yeah, it's nice.

404
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,926
Was this all you ?

405
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:06,726
Do you want a cup of coffee?

406
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:10,726
Yeah.

407
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:12,686
You weren't answering calls.

408
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:13,486
It's been...

409
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:15,166
- Or messages.
- ..really busy.

410
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,966
I've just been a bit like "Oh,
shit," you know, "What's...?"

411
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:21,366
Yeah. Work's been mad, it's been...

412
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,086
Which is good, you know, obviously,

413
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:27,086
because it's kept my mind
off everything, so...

414
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:30,806
Where's the toilet?

415
00:37:30,806 --> 00:37:32,126
Upstairs.

416
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:36,126
OK.

417
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:45,526
So, I mean, um... Yeah, let's, er...

418
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:49,686
Meet up more, yes.
Keep in touch yeah, yeah.

419
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:50,886
Yeah.

420
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:54,326
Come here.

421
00:37:54,326 --> 00:37:57,446
I think it's great you're moving on.

422
00:37:57,446 --> 00:37:58,486
What?

423
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,726
Sorry. There were...
There were man clothes, you know.

424
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,446
In the bathroom.

425
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:06,406
Right.

426
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:10,326
Is he nice?

427
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:14,326
Sorry. Big nose. You know.

428
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:18,286
You deserve whatever you want.

429
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:19,966
Thanks.

430
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:20,686
All right.

431
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:23,886
OK. All right.

432
00:38:37,126 --> 00:38:39,126
Hey.

433
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:41,246
Is everything all right?

434
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:45,246
Yeah, I'm fine. It's fine.

435
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:50,526
What did your friend say?

436
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:53,406
That was my sister.

437
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:56,366
You know her.

438
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:58,926
She said that I was...

439
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:02,926
She said that she was happy
that I'd moved on.

440
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:07,126
Moved on to what?

441
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:10,166
Is that not the sort of
thing I'd say?

442
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,126
I mean...

443
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:15,006
It is, isn't it?

444
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:16,806
Are you sure everything's all right?

445
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:18,406
Yes!

446
00:39:18,406 --> 00:39:22,406
Shit!

447
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:26,206
It's OK, I can do it. I can do it.

448
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:27,846
I can do it.

449
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:31,846
Don't!

450
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:52,766
We need to wrap that in paper.

451
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:04,406
Look, if you're going
to pretend to be asleep,

452
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:07,726
you could at least breathe, OK?

453
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:11,366
It's just eerie.

454
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:15,366
Like this?

455
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:30,726
It doesn't work.
I can tell that you're faking it.

456
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:35,046
Would you like me
to have sex with you?

457
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:39,046
Can you just go downstairs?

458
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:43,406
OK.

459
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:46,286
No! That's...

460
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,846
Ash would argue over that.

461
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,126
He wouldn't just leave
because I'd ordered him to.

462
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:52,926
OK.

463
00:40:52,926 --> 00:40:54,206
What? N...

464
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:58,206
Ah, fucking hell!

465
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:00,926
Don't cry, darling.

466
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:04,926
Oh, don't! Just get out!
Get out!

467
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,166
Go on!

468
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,566
So you do want me to go?

469
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,646
Just get out! Get out! Get out!

470
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:14,486
Get out! Get out! Get out!

471
00:41:14,486 --> 00:41:18,486
You're not enough of him!
You are nothing! You're nothing.

472
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,446
Fight me.

473
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,486
I don't do that.

474
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:24,686
Fucking fight me! Hit me.

475
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,726
Hit me. Hit me. Come on!

476
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,046
Why are you just standing
there taking this?

477
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:32,366
How can you take this?

478
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:33,806
Did I ever hit you?

479
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:37,166
N... No, of course you didn't

480
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:40,606
but you might've done if I done this.
Or this.

481
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:41,966
I don't... I don't know.

482
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,966
Maybe you would have. But you
wouldn't, would you? You wouldn't.

483
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:48,446
I could insult you.

484
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:49,726
What?

485
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:51,686
There's tons of invective

486
00:41:51,686 --> 00:41:55,166
I like speaking my mind,
I could throw some of that at you.

487
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:59,166
Get out of this house.

488
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:31,126
What are you doing?

489
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:34,446
I can't go more than 25 metres
from my activation point.

490
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:35,966
What is that, a joke?

491
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:39,086
Look, I know it sounds mental.

492
00:42:39,086 --> 00:42:41,006
Where's your activation point?

493
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:43,806
At the risk of blowing your mind...

494
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:45,926
it's where I was activated.

495
00:42:45,926 --> 00:42:46,966
The bath.

496
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:50,526
I have to keep within a 25-metre
radius unless my administrator -

497
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,966
that's you - is with me.

498
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:54,686
Don't call me your administrator.

499
00:42:54,686 --> 00:42:56,486
Why not?

500
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:57,526
Because...

501
00:42:57,526 --> 00:42:59,286
It sounds sort of sexy.

502
00:43:00,966 --> 00:43:04,246
If you're laughing,
can I come back inside?

503
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,526
Feeling a bit...

504
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:10,526
ornamental out here.

505
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,846
Funny.

506
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:30,326
Can you put that down, please?

507
00:43:30,326 --> 00:43:31,486
But it is funny.

508
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:35,486
Could you just put it down?

509
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:44,926
Come with me. We're going out.

510
00:43:56,406 --> 00:44:00,406
Cheesy.

511
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:13,566
Come on.

512
00:44:13,566 --> 00:44:15,326
Where are we going?

513
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:19,326
Just hurry up.

514
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:33,086
NO!

515
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:37,086
DON'T DO IT!

516
00:44:39,766 --> 00:44:41,566
Seriously, don't do it.

517
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:43,406
I'm not going to.

518
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:46,766
OK.

519
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:49,846
See, he would have worked out
what was going on.

520
00:44:49,846 --> 00:44:52,886
This wouldn't have ever happened,
but if it had, he would have

521
00:44:52,886 --> 00:44:53,966
worked it out.

522
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:57,966
Sorry, hang on. That's a very
difficult sentence to process.

523
00:44:58,486 --> 00:45:00,286
Jump.

524
00:45:00,286 --> 00:45:03,286
What? Over there?

525
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:06,446
I never expressed suicidal thoughts,
or self-harm.

526
00:45:06,446 --> 00:45:09,006
Yeah, well, you aren't you, are you?

527
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,486
That's another difficult one,
to be honest with you.

528
00:45:11,486 --> 00:45:15,246
You're just a few ripples of you.
There's no history to you.

529
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:19,126
You're just a performance of stuff
that he performed without thinking,

530
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:20,526
and it's not enough.

531
00:45:20,526 --> 00:45:22,166
Come on. I aim to please.

532
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,726
Aim to jump. Just do it.

533
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:26,646
OK.

534
00:45:26,646 --> 00:45:30,126
If you're absolutely sure.

535
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:31,726
See, Ash would've been scared.

536
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:34,286
He wouldn't have just leapt off,
he would have been crying,

537
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:35,366
he would have been...

538
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,366
Oh.

539
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:41,686
Oh... Oh, God, no.

540
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:44,486
Please, I don't want to do it.

541
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:45,846
Please don't make me do it.

542
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:47,206
No. That's not fair.

543
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:50,806
No, I'm... I'm frightened, darling,
please...

544
00:45:50,806 --> 00:45:52,006
Don't make me.

545
00:45:52,006 --> 00:45:54,606
I don't want to die.
Oh, God, I don't want to die

546
00:45:54,606 --> 00:45:55,646
No, that's not fair.

547
00:45:55,646 --> 00:45:57,846
I'm frightened, I don't want to die.
Don't...

548
00:45:57,846 --> 00:46:01,846
NO!!!!

549
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:22,166
One for you, one for me.

550
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:23,406
What?

551
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,486
We need another slice.

552
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:26,766
Why?

553
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:29,686
So I can take one upstairs.

554
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,366
It's not the weekend.

555
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:35,166
It is my birthday.

556
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:39,166
OK.

557
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:47,446
"Thanks, Mum."

558
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:52,246
Hey, Ash.

559
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:54,806
Hey. The birthday girl.

560
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:57,166
Just gonna come and hang out
for a bit.

561
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:59,926
OK. I wasn't doing anything.

562
00:46:59,926 --> 00:47:01,566
I brought you some cake.

563
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:03,286
I know you don't eat anything.

564
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:06,966
I'm just using you as an excuse
so I can get an extra slice.

565
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:08,486
Devious.

566
00:47:08,486 --> 00:47:09,686
Mum?

567
00:47:09,686 --> 00:47:13,566
Mum!

568
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:17,566
Yeah, I'm just coming.

569
00:47:23,514 --> 00:48:18,603
