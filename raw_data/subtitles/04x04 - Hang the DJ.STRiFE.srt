1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,920
- Coach.
- Yes, Frank?

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,960
- Where do I go?
- Proceed to the hub.

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Got ya.

4
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,880
- How will I know who he is?
- This is him.

5
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
Hi. Oh, oh.

6
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,400
Sorry. Fork.

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,320
- Amy.
- No, no, my name's not fork.

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,480
- I guessed. It was just...
- It's Frank.

9
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,640
- Do you wanna sit? Shall we sit?
- I think it's that or stand.

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,920
Come sit, yeah?

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,520
Oh, oh! That's, um...
I was on that side.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
- Oh. Shall I... ?
- No, no, it doesn't matter.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,640
Why bring it up?

14
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,080
Sorry. I'm so bloody nervous.

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,560
It's my first time on
the, you know, the system.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,680
- Me too.
- Oh, really?

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,520
Yeah, I'm shitting it, mate.

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,120
- Come to mention it, you look terrified.
- Do I?

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,920
- Yeah, quaking with fear.
- Or maybe shaking with revulsion?

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,160
At least you stopped... shitting.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
Oh!

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
Are you sure about that?

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
- Shall we stop talking about shitting?
- Maybe order some food? Good plan.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,470
Yeah. OK.

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,240
- Do you know how we order?
- I think we use these.

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,880
- Oh!
- Menu choice already established.

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,200
- Oh. Ta.
- Here you are, sir.

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
And for you, madam.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,600
Well, evidently I'm a pasta girl.

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Yeah, I'm a, uh...

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
... fishcake...

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
- It's good.
- Can I try some?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Are we... allowed to do that?

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
Fuck it.

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,720
Yeah, fuck it.

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
- Mm. That is good.
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
So... we're both first-timers.

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Hmm.

40
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,560
- Shall we check our expiry date?
- Yeah, good plan.

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,080
Yeah? All right, um, so
I think it's under "info."

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah, uh, "tap to reveal." We have
to tap to reveal at the same time.

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,240
OK. So, on three, two, one. Go.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,960
- Twelve hours.
- Yeah, 12 hours.

45
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,800
- OK.
- Bit, um...

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,120
- Yeah.
- Bit short.

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,960
- It is a bit short, isn't it?
- Hmm.

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh. And getting shorter.
I didn't realize it would...

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,400
sort of count down like that.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
It's sort of sad.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Maybe we should eat quickly.

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,440
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should.
- The race is on.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,280
Come on, hurry up.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
I guess this is us.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,840
And this takes us to the place?

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Yeah, suppose so.

57
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,760
- After you.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
It's massive.

59
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
- Here we are.
- Yep.

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,080
Huh.

61
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,920
- Do you wanna open it or shall I?
- You go ahead.

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,160
- All right.
- Ha! Too slow.

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
You're a knob.

64
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,040
Oh, God. It's a shithole.

65
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,600
- You're kidding.
- I am, yeah.

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Ooh!

67
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,080
It's nice. I, uh, like that lamp.

68
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,520
- Yeah, it's incredible, that lamp.
- Fuck off.

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Hmm.

70
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,840
Right. That's, uh...

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
There's an en suite.

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,640
- Shower or bath?
- Both.

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,680
Ah. That's good.

74
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,680
Uh. Well, I'm... I'm
just gonna use the loo.

75
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,800
Yeah, I've got to,
uh... over here, so...

76
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Yeah.

77
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
OK, seriously, what are we meant to do?

78
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,600
Query too broad. Please narrow.

79
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,360
Well, I mean, are we just meant to...
I don't know, like, just go at it?

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,760
Define "go at it."

81
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
Fucking hell.

82
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,760
So, are we meant to just
have sex with each other?

83
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,960
Participants are not required
to take any specific action.

84
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,520
Yeah, but I mean we can, right?

85
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,600
I mean, people do if
it's just a short time?

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,240
If that's your decision.

87
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,720
- It's up to us?
- It's up to you.

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,680
I could just sleep here.

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Don't be daft. You'll be
scrunched up in a ball.

90
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,920
It's not awful.

91
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
The bed's pretty big. I'm
sure we could both fit in it.

92
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
Yeah, OK.

93
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,880
Must have been mental before the system.

94
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
How do you mean?

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,720
Well, people had to do the whole
relationship thing themselves,

96
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,960
work out who they wanna be with.

97
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,880
Hmm. Option paralysis.

98
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,840
So many choices, you end up
not knowing which one you want.

99
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,800
Yeah, exactly, and
if things seem shitty,

100
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,440
they'd have to figure out whether
they wanted to break up with someone.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,440
How to break up with
someone. Fuckin' hell.

102
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,160
- Just a nightmare.
- It's not like when it's all mapped out.

103
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,880
God, no. It's so much simpler
when it's all mapped out.

104
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
Hmm.

105
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,440
- This is weird, though.
- It really is. Hmm.

106
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
- Well, then.
- So...

107
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,840
Thanks for being my first.

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Oh. Yeah.

109
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,960
Bloody time.

110
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,200
It was great, you know. You were nice.

111
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,080
So were you.

112
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,960
If we had this time again, you
would totally get it, by the way.

113
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
- Oh, you... You bastard.
- Sorry.

114
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
- You'd get it, too.
- Fucked that one up, didn't we?

115
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,840
Yeah, totally.

116
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,223
I guess I just don't see the point

117
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:24,320
in something that short. Twelve hours.

118
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,440
Even your reaction to a brief encounter

119
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,200
provides the system with
valuable information.

120
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,360
Yeah, well, I didn't even do anything.
The system thinks I'm a prude.

121
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,480
The system makes no moral judgments.

122
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,210
Yeah, but how do I know

123
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:40,000
she wasn't the perfect
match for me? She was...

124
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,880
Your ultimate compatible other
has not yet been selected.

125
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,400
Yeah, I know, but it's...

126
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
The system gains insight as
each participant progresses

127
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
through numerous relationships

128
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,924
and uses the gathered data

129
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,680
to eventually select an
ultimate compatible other.

130
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,280
On your pairing day, I know, and
it always finds your perfect match.

131
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,840
In 99.8% of cases.

132
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,120
But I have to go through loads
of relationships to find it.

133
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
- That is correct.
- Great.

134
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
What was that?

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,760
- Another relationship.
- What, already?

136
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,600
What's this, another one?

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,320
That is correct.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
I'd best go get changed, then.

139
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,480
Holy fuck. Tell me that's him.

140
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,802
I cannot confirm identity

141
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:35,440
until a personal introduction is made.

142
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

143
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Identity confirmed.

144
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,200
- I like your hair.
- Yours is good too.

145
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,960
It's all my own.

146
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,360
It's just funny.

147
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Hi.

148
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,240
I'm Frank.

149
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Hmm.

150
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,200
Nicola. I've been here a while.

151
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,760
Aye, sorry. I was getting changed.

152
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,960
- Really?
- You started already?

153
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,840
- I was hungry.
- Yeah, course, yeah. Sorry.

154
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
Come on, let's get it over
with. Checking the expiry.

155
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh! Yeah, yeah.

156
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,200
One year.

157
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,720
We've got each other for
one year? Could be a mistake.

158
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,360
- Coach, is this a mistake?
- This is not a mistake.

159
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
Jesus fucking Christ.

160
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
There'll be a reason.

161
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Thanks.

162
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,360
Look on the bright side.
Chicken tikka masala.

163
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
What?

164
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,720
Chicken tikka mas... It's a joke.

165
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,240
Right. So you're the sort
of person that makes jokes.

166
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
- OK, so on three.
- Two, one.

167
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,360
Oh. Interesting.

168
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Nine months.

169
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,520
Well... cheers.

170
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Cheers.

171
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,200
Pretty much the same as my last one.

172
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,840
- How many of these have you had?
- Relationships? So far? Five.

173
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,240
- Oh.
- I'm an old hand, I suppose.

174
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Listen, I'm just gonna
jump in the shower.

175
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,320
- OK.
- Won't be long.

176
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,480
Hey.

177
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Hi.

178
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,960
So, listen, if you're OK with it,

179
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,480
this is relationship five for me,

180
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,200
and I've found it's best to
have sex straight away upfront.

181
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,440
Right, yeah.

182
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,187
Kind of breaks the ice,

183
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:03,800
gives an early overview
of compatibility and so on.

184
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,720
Yep.

185
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,560
So I'm consenting to everything now.

186
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,480
Whenever you feel
comfortable doing the same...

187
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,080
Tikka masala. Just...

188
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,880
- What?
- It's a bit tikka masala.

189
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,600
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Talking makes it worse.

190
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Sorry.

191
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,400
No, no, you're gonna
have to do it from behind.

192
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,280
- You what?
- From behind.

193
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,000
Bit faster?

194
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,560
More motion.

195
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,000
Not like that. More motion.
You're all in out, in out,

196
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,440
like you're trying to shut a
drawer into a filing cabinet.

197
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,400
- Sorry.
- It's just boring.

198
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,120
Want a bit more side to side.

199
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Like this?

200
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,520
No, not really.

201
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,760
What was that?

202
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,000
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

203
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,040
Fucking hell.

204
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,280
So I can't just walk away?

205
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,000
That is correct.

206
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,120
One day it will provide
you with the ultimate match.

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,880
One day. One day.

208
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,280
So I'd just like to say,

209
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,240
do have faith in the system,
because it does deliver.

210
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
It did for us.

211
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,160
You have so many experiences,

212
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,720
and then one day it pairs you
up with your ultimate match,

213
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,280
the best in show, as it were.

214
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Ha.

215
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,120
So if you're having doubts,
just hang on in there.

216
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,880
Because it really does work.

217
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,600
Garlic dip. Thanks for that.

218
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,680
- Hi. Hi.
- Mm!

219
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,880
Was that, uh, your... ?

220
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,800
- Yeah. Nicola.
- Oh. Nicola.

221
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,160
- Hmm.
- Ha.

222
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,040
You OK?

223
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,280
No, you're not being...

224
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,240
Oh, my God. OK, this is
happening. OK, um, just...

225
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,040
Oh. Thanks.

226
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,600
- You look well.
- Thanks.

227
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,600
I'd return the compliment, but you've
just spat food on my shoe, so...

228
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,960
To be fair, it is a
revolting shoe, so...

229
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,680
All the better to kick you with.

230
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,240
Was that really hard?

231
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,680
- Ouch.
- I'm so sorry. Fuck.

232
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,640
Shit.

233
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,240
Oh. Oh! Um... Uh...

234
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,680
Lenny, this is, um, Frank.
Frank, this is Lenny.

235
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
- Hi, Lenny. You all right?
- Hi.

236
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,320
We were together for a bit.

237
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,880
- A small... small bit.
- Yeah, just before we...

238
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,920
So you two... ? Oh.
That's... that's great.

239
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,920
So, I mean... it looks like
you two make a great team.

240
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,960
Yeah.

241
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,360
- Yeah.
- Um, I'll see you.

242
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Yeah.

243
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,280
- You know that noise you make?
- What noise?

244
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,160
- Do I do that?
- Yeah, you do, quite often.

245
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
Does it bother you?

246
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,640
A bit, yeah.

247
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,840
- I'll try not to.
- OK.

248
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,360
So it's been great, really.

249
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,320
- Shame it has to end.
- But end it must.

250
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Anyway...

251
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,000
OK, bye.

252
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,080
Another partner already?

253
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,960
That is correct.

254
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,320
So, three, two, one, go.

255
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,400
Thirty-six hours?

256
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,200
Well, uh... bye.

257
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

258
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,600
Three, two, one.

259
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,480
- I just wanna say...
- Don't.

260
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,120
Well, I learned what it's like
to cohabit with someone I despise.

261
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,720
- Is that useful for the system?
- Everything happens for a reason.

262
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,120
That's sooner than I expected.

263
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
- Hello, you.
- Hi.

264
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,160
Hi.

265
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,920
Is this right?

266
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,600
- Yeah.
- I mean...

267
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,480
Yeah, I didn't think the
system would hook us up again.

268
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,040
No, me neither. I mean, I hope
it's right, obviously, but...

269
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,720
- Coach, are we sat at the right table?
- Yes, that is correct.

270
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,000
OK, well...

271
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,840
Wait, um... Can we not
check the expiry date?

272
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,280
- Uh... Why?
- Just sick of it.

273
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,898
The system's just bounced
me from bloke to bloke,

274
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,840
short fling after short fling.

275
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,360
I know they're short flings,
they're just meaningless,

276
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,160
and I get really detached.
It's like I'm not really there.

277
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,560
So the other week, I was with this guy,
God knows who, basically just a haircut.

278
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,560
And I literally had this
out-of-body experience.

279
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I wandered out of my body, and I
sat in this chair across the room

280
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,612
and I watched myself fucking this guy.

281
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,213
And I was, like, what is that all about?

282
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
That is literally just a dick
going in and out of a hole.

283
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,720
Yeah, that's pretty detached.

284
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,000
When it's a long-term
thing, it's just as bad,

285
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,051
watching the clock
like you're a prisoner,

286
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:53,560
counting the hours, the minutes.

287
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,240
- Oh, God, I've been there.
- Yeah.

288
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,440
- Yeah, let's not check the expiry, then.
- Yeah.

289
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
- It's a deal.
- Deal.

290
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,200
- OK.
- Bring on les fishcake.

291
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
I don't know.

292
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,600
- So?
- So...

293
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,280
- Might as well.
- I suppose we have to.

294
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,000
- Don't know how much time we've got.
- Yeah, it could be ten minutes.

295
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,680
- Think you could last ten minutes?
- Fuck off.

296
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,920
All right. OK, then.

297
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,680
Wait. One of us should
get undressed first.

298
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,280
- Why only one of us?
- It'll be funny.

299
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,680
Go on then. Get your kit off.

300
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,920
No. No, it was my idea.

301
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,040
All right.

302
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,560
This is kind of emasculating.

303
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,440
Well, then, you'd better
make up for it in a minute.

304
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,120
♪ I'm gonna see your dick ♪

305
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,840
Sorry.

306
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,960
- ♪ I'm gonna fucking see it ♪
- Yeah, OK. Yeah...

307
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,539
What if there is no scrutiny,

308
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,840
it's just putting us
together in any old order,

309
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,043
and we all go along with it

310
00:29:57,044 --> 00:29:59,480
'cause they're always
telling us how clever it is?

311
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,952
Yeah, but it does put
people with the one.

312
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:04,200
It's got a 99.8% success rate.

313
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
But how do you know
they're perfect matches?

314
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,800
I mean, what if all it's actually
doing is gradually wearing us down,

315
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,280
putting us in one
relationship after another

316
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
for random durations
in a random sequence?

317
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,760
Each time you get a little bit more
pliable, a little bit more broken,

318
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,273
until eventually it coughs up

319
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:24,280
the final offering and
says that's the one.

320
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,480
And by that point you are
so defeated and so exhausted

321
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,600
that you just accept it, you settle.

322
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,440
And then you have to
live the rest of your life

323
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,640
convincing yourself you didn't.

324
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,360
Well done. That's one of the
bleakest things I've ever heard.

325
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,160
Thank you.

326
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,143
Right. Do you wanna know my theory?

327
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:52,680
Let's assume the system isn't random.

328
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,000
- It's as sophisticated as they say it is.
- OK.

329
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,160
Right, so using these, it slurps
up all your reactions, yeah?

330
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,200
- It builds up a complex profile.
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,720
Every crazy thought you've ever had,

332
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:05,680
all your dreams and
your weaknesses and...

333
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,440
- And your mad theories.
- Yeah, like, everything in your head.

334
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,080
- Right.
- So if it's everything in your head...

335
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
- does it have thoughts?
- All right, so now you're gonna say:

336
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,748
"What if that's us

337
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,960
and we're stuck in a simulation?"

338
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,560
Well, how would we know?

339
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,120
I think that settles it.

340
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,440
I might have been programmed to go "Ow."

341
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,400
OK.

342
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
- Hey, come here.
- No.

343
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
- Coach?
- Hello, Frank.

344
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,080
- I've gotta know.
- What would you like to know?

345
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,920
The expiry date for me and
Amy. I need to know how long.

346
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,920
You're not gonna talk me out of it?

347
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,960
Would you like me to talk you out of it?

348
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,120
Yeah. Uh... No. I...

349
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Don't know.

350
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,840
No, I'm not gonna do
it. I said I wouldn't.

351
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,560
We shook on it.

352
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,680
Fuck it.

353
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,520
Recalibrating.

354
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Coach?

355
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,680
- Coach.
- Recalibrating.

356
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,000
What's happening? Coach,
it's getting shorter.

357
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,320
One-sided observation has
destabilized the expiry date.

358
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,360
- What?
- One-sided observation

359
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,520
has destabilized the expiry date.

360
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,200
Recalibrating.

361
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,520
'Cause I looked at it on
my own, it made it shorter?

362
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,440
- That is correct.
- Why?

363
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,560
Everything happens for a reason.

364
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,000
All right, well, undo
it, then. Make it go back.

365
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,680
I cannot do that. Recalibrating.

366
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,040
What if she looks at it?

367
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,680
Once shortened, the expiry
date cannot be extended.

368
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,120
Why?

369
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,600
Everything happens for a reason.

370
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,600
- Come on. Come on.
- Recalibrating.

371
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,280
- When will it stop?
- It will stabilize

372
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,360
once recalibration has
completed. Recalibrating.

373
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,840
Stop it. Stop it. Just...

374
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,080
You OK?

375
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

376
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
- All right.
- I'm good.

377
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,560
Have you ever had more
than four or less than four?

378
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,720
What you thinking about?

379
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Nothing.

380
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,360
All right, seriously, what's up?

381
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
- I looked.
- Looked at what?

382
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,240
We promised we wouldn't. We shook on it.

383
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,400
- Don't you wanna know what it said?
- No. That was the point.

384
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,520
- It's almost done anyway.
- How almost done?

385
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,840
We've got, like, an hour.

386
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,880
Why didn't you tell me this before?

387
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,600
- Didn't wanna spoil today.
- And this hasn't spoilt it?

388
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,920
It was supposed to be
five years, but now...

389
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,520
I looked at it, something
happened, it started going down.

390
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,560
- I don't know what it was.
- So you broke it?

391
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,640
No, no, no, no, no. I mean,
I don't... I don't know.

392
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,960
Why did you have to look at it?

393
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,120
Look, I was thinking maybe
we could overcome it somehow.

394
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,600
Why did you have to look at it?

395
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,000
Because I like you.

396
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,840
Like properly, really, I like you.

397
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,800
- For fuck's sake. And that wasn't enough?
- That's not the point.

398
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,720
- I looked, but that's not the issue here.
- Are you sure about that?

399
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,560
You're more wound up about
that than how short the time is.

400
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,880
Yes, because we had agreed.

401
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,000
Listen. Listen. Listen.

402
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,000
- What if we just ignore it?
- We can't.

403
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,720
Listen, we'll just fuck
the system. We'll fuck it...

404
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,160
- And do what?
- We'll jump out, over the wall, get out.

405
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,400
- There is nothing out there.
- How d'you know? How d'you know?

406
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,800
- Amy...
- You've ruined this.

407
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,480
You've ruined it.

408
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,640
Hey, it's nothing.

409
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,240
- Amy.
- Don't follow me.

410
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,280
Amy, I'm sorry.

411
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
Amy.

412
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,520
- Everything happens for a reason.
- What reason?

413
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,640
The system will be
assessing your reaction

414
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,160
to the painful premature termination
of a treasured relationship

415
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,306
and will adjust and improve its profile

416
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:51,600
of your eventual chosen one accordingly.

417
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,440
- You're a great comfort.
- Thank you.

418
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,640
I swear to God, I feel like
scaling the wall out there

419
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,840
and jumping in the fucking wilderness.

420
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,440
That would contravene
the rules of the system.

421
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,680
Oh, the fucking system.

422
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,520
Failure to comply with the
system may result in banishment.

423
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,480
All right, I know.

424
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,120
Christ, will you let me be angry
at least? Will you give me that?

425
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,144
You must vacate your
current living quarters

426
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:29,080
when the time expires.

427
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,000
Like I didn't know.

428
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,200
And if I hadn't have looked,
we'd have been together years.

429
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,080
She was...

430
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,936
You know when you meet someone

431
00:42:26,937 --> 00:42:31,320
and you just know? You just know that...

432
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,680
Reckon you could pop this in me
now? I've sort of got jaw ache.

433
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah, come on.

434
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,880
And after all that, he never
even apologized, not once.

435
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,520
That's too bad.

436
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,760
Do you mind if I think about her?

437
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,560
If I can think about him?

438
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,680
Yeah, sound.

439
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,840
One, two, three, four.

440
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,840
One, two, three, four.

441
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,760
Congratulations, Amy. Your
ultimate match has been identified.

442
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,600
Your pairing day is tomorrow.

443
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,560
- Ultimate as in "the one"?
- That is correct.

444
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,920
- And we meet tomorrow?
- That is correct.

445
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,560
Tomorrow you'll be coupled
with your ultimate match

446
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,200
and together you will
leave this place forever.

447
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,160
OK.

448
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,120
Are you allowed to tell
me anything about them?

449
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,160
- Do I know them already?
- Negative.

450
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,480
- Right.
- There is one more thing.

451
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,680
Yeah, and what's that?

452
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,187
Prior to pairing day,

453
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,400
you have been allocated
a short farewell period

454
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,280
with an individual of your choosing.

455
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,080
A farewell period? Like, I
get to say goodbye to someone?

456
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,640
That is correct.

457
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,320
Data shows this can help
provide psychological closure.

458
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,120
Frank, I choose Frank.

459
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,000
Your choice has been registered.

460
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,120
Wait. Where are we meeting?

461
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,720
Usual booth, 7:30 p.m.

462
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Right.

463
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,600
- Coach?
- Yes, Amy?

464
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,840
Count to four.

465
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,160
One, two, three, four.

466
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,800
Wait, wait. How long have we got?

467
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,360
Look, the system's set my
pairing day for tomorrow.

468
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,160
- Yeah, me too.
- Right.

469
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,760
I don't want whoever the
system reckons the one is, OK?

470
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,120
- I want you.
- I want you.

471
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,000
Failure to comply with the system

472
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,920
- may result in banishment.
- You can fuck off.

473
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,120
Can you remember where you
were before you came here?

474
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,120
You can't, can you?

475
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,280
- No.
- Me neither.

476
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,360
- Why can't I think of that?
- It's a test.

477
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,300
Do you remember the first night

478
00:45:49,301 --> 00:45:51,760
that we were together? How did you feel?

479
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,000
I felt safe, happy, comfortable.

480
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,983
It felt right.

481
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:03,240
It felt like something locked
into place, like we'd met before.

482
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,440
Like it had happened before
and it'll happen again,

483
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,200
like it's happened a thousand
times over and over again.

484
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,280
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

485
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,160
Ever since we've met, this
world has been toying with us.

486
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,520
It's trying to keep us apart. It's...

487
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,040
It's a test, I swear it is,

488
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,654
and the two of us rebelling together

489
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:22,120
is something to do with passing it.

490
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,600
We've gotta fuck it all off.

491
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,360
Exactly. We've just gotta fuck
the whole thing off and go.

492
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,520
- Yeah, over the wall.
- Right over it.

493
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,760
- No matter what's out there.
- OK.

494
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,840
So let's go.

495
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,720
Yeah, let's go.

496
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,600
