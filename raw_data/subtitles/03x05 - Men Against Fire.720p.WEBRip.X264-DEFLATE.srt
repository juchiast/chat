3
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:14,590
Okay, my people! Rise
and shine. Get up, Stripe.

4
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,270
Hey. You awake yet?

5
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,390
- Sure as shit ain't dreaming no more.
- Company!

6
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,270
Something went down
last night in Her Falls,

7
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,670
a village about three miles east.

8
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,110
We've got reports of a food
store broken into, shit stolen.

9
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,510
Locals think it's roaches.

10
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,830
Roaches!

11
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,910
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!

12
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,830
Hey, so, it looks like you're getting
your first real-live roach hunt, huh?

13
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,310
Hey, new!

14
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,390
New!

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,310
It's Stripe.

16
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,510
Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

17
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,150
- with one of them roaches today.
- Uh-huh?

18
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,670
When you see one right here,

19
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,190
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

20
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,110
- I'll try.
- Try to ignore Len.

21
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,550
His aim's so bad, he's
the only guy on Earth

22
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,710
who could shit his own pants and miss.

23
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,110
- Fuck you, farm girl.
- Farm girl?

24
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,270
Yeah. Hunting's in my blood.

25
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,310
Some of us are naturals.

26
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,190
Moving out!

27
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,990
Whoo! Yeah!

28
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

29
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,190
You can speak now.

30
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,390
- It must have been roaches.
- Roaches, you see them? You see?

31
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,550
I didn't see them.

32
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,790
I heard them. All the mess.
It must have been them.

33
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,070
Want a cookie?

34
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,550
- Here you go.
- They've been in the food.

35
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,390
We'll have to destroy
everything they left.

36
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,350
No one will eat it.

37
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,830
We can replace that, okay?

38
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,110
They destroyed the cooler.
Broke it and took the parts.

39
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,910
The cooler? They stole
parts from the cooler?

40
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,830
Which way did they go?

41
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,270
There were footprints in
the dirt leading that way.

42
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,510
Parn Heidekker.

43
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,030
Parn Heidekker.

44
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,070
Heidekker? Is that a name?

45
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,790
Stop them coming. Please, you must stop.

46
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,790
Okay.

47
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,350
I have child who is scared.

48
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,070
I will. I promise.

49
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,830
Stripe!

50
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,830
Okay. Our friend here
thinks that the roaches

51
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,670
went in the direction of
Parn Heidekker's place.

52
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,030
Local oddball, seems to be
some kind of religious freak.

53
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,430
Anderson, Hague, I want you to stay
here and help them torch the food,

54
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,910
keep them calm and reassured.

55
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,270
The rest of you, we're
gonna drop in on Heidekker.

56
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,270
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

57
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,110
If there's roaches, we show
we're ready for them. Let's go.

58
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,230
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly what
you call a socialite or a mingler.

59
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,750
Seems like mental health issues.

60
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,550
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

61
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,750
I'm putting his info
in your Mass system now.

62
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,310
Been complaints lodged
against him going months back.

63
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,670
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

64
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,430
Could be just shit talk from
the local villagers though so...

65
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,990
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

66
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,030
A couple of thousand? A
couple of hundred, if that?

67
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,950
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

68
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,990
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

69
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,870
Out here you got rustic
fucks throwing them scraps.

70
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,950
No wonder it's taken
so long to mop shit up.

71
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,430
But how can anyone be dumb
enough to help a fucking roach?

72
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,790
Hell, yeah.

73
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,390
Portals front and rear.

74
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,550
Windows blacked out.

75
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,390
Chimney smoke. Someone's home.

76
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,270
Lennard, you use the boomer.

77
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,750
Okay, Mass check.
Everyone got the layout?

78
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,870
- Check.
- Check.

79
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,150
Check.

80
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,470
Aikin, Valcon, Coach, you
check the outbuildings here.

81
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,030
Take them one at a time and slow.

82
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,790
Stripe, Raiman, you
come with me and Lennard.

83
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,230
We go in here.

84
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,110
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

85
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,630
Okay.

86
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,790
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

87
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,110
Except on a roach.

88
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,230
Except on a roach.

89
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,750
Morning, sir.

90
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,030
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

91
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,390
Okay.

92
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,710
- What is it you want?
- Just to talk.

93
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,150
That's what we're doing.

94
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,190
Be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

95
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,270
Check the upstairs rooms.

96
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,870
Relax. I'm not your enemy.

97
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,710
Where are they?

98
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,910
Where are who?

99
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,590
You know, we got a whole bunch

100
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,830
of frightened, angry
people in that village.

101
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,350
Roaches have been breaking into
the food stores, stealing supplies.

102
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,590
You know anything about that?

103
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,630
No.

104
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,070
See, it's not just what they stole.

105
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,790
All that food left
is gonna be destroyed.

106
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,790
- No one's gonna eat it.
- Stripe.

107
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,150
Makes life harder for everyone.

108
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,190
Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

109
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,390
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

110
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,470
I agree. All life is sacred so...

111
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,670
you even got to protect
the roaches. Right?

112
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,590
It's not their fault they're like
that. They didn't ask for this.

113
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,070
I get it. We get it.

114
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,870
Mm-hmm.

115
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,390
There's shit in their blood
that made them that way.

116
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,030
The sickness they're carrying.

117
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,150
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

118
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,390
or the pain about who
else is gonna suffer.

119
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,310
We don't stop the roaches, in
five, ten, 20 years from now,

120
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,230
you're still gonna get kids born that
way, and then they're gonna breed.

121
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,630
Bingo.

122
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,190
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

123
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,030
That sickness, and it
could have been avoided.

124
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,270
Fucking roach nest.

125
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,190
You check in there.
I'll take the stairs.

126
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,150
Every roach you save today,

127
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,310
you condemn God knows how many
people to despair and misery tomorrow.

128
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,470
You can't still see them as human.

129
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,310
Understandable sentiment,
granted, but it's misguided.

130
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,830
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

131
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,950
That's just the hard truth.

132
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,990
Gotta make sacrifices.

133
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,830
What the fuck?

134
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,390
Help me out here!

135
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,470
Fuck!

136
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,790
♪ Try to shame me and still I'll care ♪

137
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,790
♪ You can run around, even put me down ♪

138
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,910
♪ I'll still be there for you ♪

139
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,150
Rai!

140
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,630
We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday
School all the way back to base?

141
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,270
You can cover your ears.

142
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,470
Yeah, or, uh.... I'll
just hit permanent mute.

143
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,390
Lower your weapon.

144
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,310
Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?

145
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,230
He's a civ, right?

146
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,670
You shoot a civ, that's gonna stay
with you the rest of your life.

147
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,030
Yo, Stripe, why don't you, uh...
pull the stick out of your ass?

148
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,870
Because I'm fucking with him, not you.

149
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,230
I guess I had you both going, right?

150
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,310
All right!

151
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,670
Let's torch the place.

152
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,110
Hey, you okay, man?

153
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,070
Yeah.

154
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,110
- I heard you popped one in there.
- Two.

155
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,150
Wait, two?

156
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,270
- I got another one, with my knife.
- With your knife? Holy shit!

157
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,150
- Pretty good, right?
- Yeah, you fucking Terminator.

158
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,870
Damn! First time out, he gets two.

159
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,670
You lucky motherfucker, man.

160
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,190
Sweet dreams for this asshole.

161
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,910
Gonna get a treat tonight.

162
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,870
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

163
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,550
I love you.

164
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,470
Whoa! Miss Sharp Shooter.

165
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,990
Patronising fuck!

166
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,670
_

167
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,350
Ruthless! You're the Grim Reaper.

168
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,870
Yeah, well, no roach
gets away next time.

169
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,870
Are you still sweating that?

170
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,750
Well, I grew up tracking
deer. You never give up.

171
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,110
I don't like it when they get away.

172
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,590
_

173
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,710
Nice.

174
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,550
Yeah, if that fucker
made it to the forest,

175
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,150
probably made it to the
border, gone for good.

176
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,750
Yeah. It's all right for you.

177
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,630
You popped two of 'em.

178
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,630
It's been a while for me.

179
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,030
You know, the gal is getting twitchy.

180
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,710
Come on, Rai.

181
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,310
You sleep good?

182
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,470
Yeah, I slept OK.

183
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,230
What, that's all you're gonna give me?

184
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,310
Okay? You know, if I got two in one go,

185
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,190
I would want to come for like an hour!

186
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,470
All right, shut up.

187
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,270
All right.

188
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,150
Ah! That's the way.

189
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,190
Hey, you okay, man?

190
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,990
Yeah, think I'm tired is all.

191
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,830
Uh-huh? All right, so
you did have a good night.

192
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,750
39, 40, 41....

193
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,190
42...

194
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,950
43, 44, 45, 46,

195
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,430
47, 48, 49,

196
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,510
50, 51, 52,

197
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,910
53, 54, 55,

198
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,670
56, 57, 58, 59...

199
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,190
Strong and pure.

200
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,990
Strong and pure.

201
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,990
- Hey, Stripe, you okay?
- Yeah.

202
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,230
I mean, I... don't know.

203
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,950
I feel a little off.

204
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,230
I mean, I ain't sick or
nothing. It's just, uh...

205
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,070
Report to the sick bay.

206
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,390
Running diagnostic.

207
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,830
What do you see?

208
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,870
A cube.

209
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,110
- Rotating?
- Yeah.

210
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,110
- And now?
- A tree.

211
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,750
- Like an apple tree.
- Touch the apples for me.

212
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,150
Full marks.

213
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,070
- So you say you had like a headache?
- Yeah, but just quick.

214
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,510
Nothing big, just...

215
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,310
Well, everything looks okay.

216
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,990
No sign of any malfunction or
dropout with your Mass implant.

217
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,950
And physically, you're
in exemplary shape.

218
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,630
You've just seen combat, you can
expect some sort of side effect.

219
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,070
There was this, uh... this thing...

220
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,110
with a light on it at the farmhouse.

221
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,470
- Roach had it.
- A roach had it?

222
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,830
- Kind of like a flashlight.
- Flashlight?

223
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,270
Kinda.

224
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,630
I don't know.

225
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:26,030
Seriously, you're fine. Your Mass
is fine. Blood's fine. It's all fine.

226
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,070
Okay. Yeah.

227
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,470
Maybe you should speak to Arquette.

228
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,950
Who's Arquette?

229
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,270
So, you must be Koinanchey?

230
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,470
Koinange. Folks call me Stripe.

231
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,070
Why would they call you that?

232
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,630
Couldn't pronounce
Koinange either, I guess.

233
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,350
- That's funny.
- Thank you.

234
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,150
At ease, son. Sit down.

235
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,350
So you recently logged your first kills?

236
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,270
- Two roaches?
- Uh-huh.

237
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,910
First time out. It's impressive.

238
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,190
Yeah, I guess.

239
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,030
So what happened?

240
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,350
- What, with the kills?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,670
Oh. I'm in this, uh... farmhouse.

242
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,350
There's this, like,
hidden room or something.

243
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,790
We go in and there they are.

244
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,190
First one, I just... It was
automatic. Just pop-pop, you know?

245
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,630
Right. Just like in training.

246
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,590
Yeah, just like that, yeah. Yeah.

247
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,830
- And the second?
- I mean, he was on the ground with me.

248
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,150
He?

249
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,150
It was a he.

250
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,710
Oh.

251
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,230
So, this was close quarters then?

252
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,630
Yeah, he's on top of
me. Struggling, I mean...

253
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,590
I couldn't reach my rifle
so I had to stick him.

254
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,270
Stick it. With my knife.

255
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,630
And how did that... feel?

256
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,110
- What, like...?
- Emotionally.

257
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,270
I didn't. I mean, it was
quick. It was self-protection.

258
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,990
I guess all I felt
was, you know, relief.

259
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,190
- Just relief?
- Uh-huh.

260
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,950
It's not unusual to
experience other feelings too.

261
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,510
A moment of euphoria even.

262
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,030
Yeah, I guess.

263
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,630
I don't know, I thought
maybe I'd feel...

264
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,950
I don't know.

265
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,710
- Something else?
- Yeah, like...

266
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,750
Regret. Something like that,
but that just wasn't there.

267
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,910
Hmm.

268
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,230
So you'd do it again?

269
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,910
Yeah, sure.

270
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,670
So... why are you here?

271
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,350
I don't know. I mean...

272
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,830
I had a few weird moments.

273
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,750
My Mass looked like
it was glitching out.

274
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,790
But your implants, I mean,
they passed every diagnostic.

275
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,350
- There is nothing wrong with that?
- Yeah, they said it's fine.

276
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,990
I don't know, I think I just...

277
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,470
Felt like something was up with it.

278
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,430
- But there's not.
- No.

279
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,710
You did a big thing. You
should be proud of yourself.

280
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,070
Okay?

281
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,870
It'll pass.

282
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,670
Let's get you a good sleep tonight, huh?

283
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,750
A real good sleep.

284
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,430
Fuck me.

285
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,270
Way to go, fuck fingers.

286
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,510
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent
too long once we got to work on him.

287
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,910
He's given up a location, someplace
the roaches have been scavenging.

288
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,230
Well, all right.

289
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,390
It's a housing project that's
been empty since the war.

290
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,550
It's not far from here.

291
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,750
So control wants us to do
recon before we go back to base.

292
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,270
Can we hurry it up here?

293
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,830
We ought to burn the
whole forest down, huh?

294
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,670
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

295
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,670
Okay, you see that?

296
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,510
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

297
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,590
And there are some cables.

298
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,350
- There's got to be roaches leaching power.
- Why here?

299
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,030
Christ knows.

300
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,790
All right.

301
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,670
Better dial it in.

302
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,230
Control. This is Medina.

303
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,550
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

304
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,550
Sighted one solar panel, looks
recently wiped clean and some cabling.

305
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,230
Roger so far.

306
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,070
- You all right there?
- Smell the grass.

307
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,030
We can't usually smell nothing.

308
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,550
- You ever noticed that?
- No, I never noticed that.

309
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,670
Requesting course of action.

310
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,470
Didn't read. Please repeat.

311
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,870
Okay.

312
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,030
Control says we should
fall back and await comm...

313
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,670
Shit!

314
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,270
Medina.

315
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,070
Oh!

316
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,630
Medina.

317
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,430
Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!

318
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,310
Okay. Ready? Cover me.

319
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,790
Rai! Rai, come on.

320
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,390
Okay.

321
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,270
Oh, fucking roach got
a rifle. Jesus Christ.

322
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,510
Fuck. Piece of shit.

323
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,430
Okay, Stripe.

324
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,950
Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

325
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,350
He fired six shots. His
rifle looks old, bolt action.

326
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,670
- Should take him ten seconds to reload.
- We go in?

327
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,150
We go in and take him
out. Are you with me?

328
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,270
- I'm with you.
- Let's go!

329
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,470
Follow me!

330
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,910
Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me.

331
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,070
Come on, man! What the fuck?

332
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,590
What the fuck is this shit?

333
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,350
Let's go.

334
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,910
Stripe!

335
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,910
Whoa, whoa! It's okay. Hey. Hey.

336
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,990
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

337
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,030
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

338
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,110
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

339
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,830
Go on, get out of here. Go on.

340
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,350
It's not safe. There's roaches here.

341
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,790
Go on. Get.

342
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,470
Come on!

343
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,830
- Rai, what did you do?
- Shut up! Come on!

344
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,870
What did you do, Rai?

345
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,550
Got ya.

346
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,670
Rai!

347
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,150
No!

348
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,070
- Run!
- What the fuck are you doing?

349
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,190
- You're killing them!
- They're roaches!

350
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,990
You're fucking killing
them, Rai! Fuck you!

351
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,550
What the fuck's wrong with you,
man? You got some blown shit.

352
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,510
- Pull it together!
- No.

353
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,670
Are you all right?

354
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,750
You gotta get out of here. Come on.

355
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,670
Come on!

356
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,550
Fuck!

357
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,230
You better run.

358
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,750
Shh. Shh.

359
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,150
Here.

360
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,270
I'm all right.

361
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,150
You see me as I am.

362
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,670
Of course I see you.

363
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,790
You don't see roach?

364
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,670
You ain't a roach.

365
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,630
Roaches is all...

366
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,710
Fucked up?

367
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,390
Roaches don't speak.

368
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,710
You just can't hear us.

369
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,390
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Your implants. Your army implants.

370
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,150
The Mass system?

371
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,550
They put it in your
head to help you fight,

372
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,590
and when it works, you
see us as something other.

373
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,750
One of us, Luka, was
making a... a machine.

374
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,270
Light flashes. Said it can
interfere with the implant.

375
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,710
You're roaches?

376
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,950
But I've seen roaches.

377
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,790
I've seen them, they're
fucking... They're like, uh...

378
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,150
- Animals?
- No, they're monsters. I've seen them.

379
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,230
The implant made you see this.

380
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,670
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

381
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:54,870
The locals, they... they ain't army.
They got no Mass in their heads.

382
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,510
They're scared of the roaches.

383
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,710
- They hate the fucking things.
- Everybody hates us.

384
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,350
Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

385
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,190
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

386
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,990
What you see now.

387
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,190
They hate all the same because
it's what they've been told.

388
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,110
Ten years ago, it began.

389
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,630
Post-war.

390
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,710
First, the screening
programme, the DNA checks,

391
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,190
then the register,
the emergency measures.

392
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,150
And soon everyone calls us
creatures. Filthy creatures.

393
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,150
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

394
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,830
Say we have... we have sickness in us.

395
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,830
We have weakness. It's in our blood.

396
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,750
They say that our blood cannot go on.

397
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,990
That we cannot go on.

398
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,390
My name was Catarina.

399
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,830
He was Alec.

400
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,630
Now we're just roach.

401
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,470
But now...

402
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,030
Now you see me.

403
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,750
Now you see me.

404
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,670
Rai?

405
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,990
Rai, no!

406
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,990
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

407
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,550
- None of it's true, Rai.
- What the fuck got you?

408
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,870
None of it's true.

409
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,830
Fuck you.

410
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,950
Get up. Back against the wall.

411
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,910
Get up!

412
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,670
You want me to come in there?

413
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,430
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

414
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,390
Thank you, Briley.

415
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,750
Stripe.

416
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,350
We owe you an apology. We didn't
spot the fault in your Mass.

417
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,190
I got you a coffee.

418
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,270
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

419
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,270
Is this the thing?

420
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,550
We found it on an old block that
you and Raiman were searching.

421
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:46,110
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

422
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:53,430
The light here transmits
a code. It's like a virus.

423
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,550
It burrows into your Mass, trying
to shut it down from within.

424
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,510
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

425
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,830
than we give them credit for.

426
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,270
The whole thing is a lie.

427
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,150
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

428
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,550
Roaches.

429
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,590
They look just like us.

430
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,870
Of course they do.

431
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,910
That's why they're so dangerous.

432
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:27,150
Humans. You know, we
give ourselves a bad rap,

433
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,230
but we're genuinely
empathetic as a species.

434
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,310
I mean, we don't actually
really want to kill each other.

435
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,310
Which is a good thing.

436
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,910
Until your future depends
on wiping out the enemy.

437
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,230
Come on, sit down.

438
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,590
I don't know how much
history you studied in school.

439
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,230
Many years ago, I'm
talking early 20th century,

440
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,270
most soldiers didn't
even fire their weapons.

441
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:12,990
Or if they did, they would just
aim over the heads of the enemies.

442
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,310
They did it on purpose.

443
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,670
British Army. World War I.

444
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,190
The brigadier, he'd walk
the line with a stick

445
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,150
and he'd whack his men in
order to get them to shoot.

446
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,190
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

447
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,270
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

448
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:37,750
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% of them fired.

449
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,430
Now what does that tell you?

450
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,710
It tells me that that war would
have been over a whole lot quicker

451
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,190
had the military got its shit together.

452
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,670
So we adapted.

453
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,910
Better training. Better conditioning.

454
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,510
Then comes the Vietnam War,

455
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,470
and the shooting
percentage goes up to 85.

456
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,070
Lot of bullets flying.
The kills were still low.

457
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,910
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

458
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,870
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

459
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,750
And that's pretty much how things
stayed until Mass came along.

460
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,910
You see, Mass... Well, that's
the ultimate military weapon.

461
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,390
It helps you with your intel.

462
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,150
Your targeting. Your
comms. Your conditioning.

463
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:34,430
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

464
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,470
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

465
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,390
You don't hear the shrieks.

466
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,350
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

467
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,070
They're human beings.

468
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:55,070
Do you have any idea the amount
of shit that's in their DNA?

469
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,030
Higher rates of cancer.

470
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:04,230
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

471
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,470
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

472
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,590
It's all there.

473
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,670
The screening shows it.

474
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,990
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

475
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,950
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

476
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,230
The villagers won't do it.

477
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,590
The folks back home won't do it.

478
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,110
They don't have Mass.

479
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,150
Mass lets you do it.

480
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,030
You.

481
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,390
You're protecting the bloodline.

482
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,510
And that, my friend, is an honour.

483
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,750
There's no honour here.

484
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:48,750
It's just killing.

485
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:54,230
- Lying and killing.
- No one lied to you.

486
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,590
You knew all of this. All along.

487
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,270
What are you talking about?

488
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,950
You agreed to have your
Mass implant put in.

489
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,910
Set up. Every soldier does.

490
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,430
We can't just embed it and feed you
a dream. Your mind would reject it.

491
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,790
You have to accept it. Willingly.

492
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,790
It's exactly what you did.

493
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,670
So you see the terms
and conditions there?

494
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,510
Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.

495
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,390
What is that?

496
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:35,030
That's your consent video. From
when you signed up six months ago.

497
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,510
Basically, it says you agree
to Mass implant activation.

498
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,110
- I didn't do this.
- Yes, you did.

499
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,550
- Works kind of like hypnosis.
- Yeah, all right.

500
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,910
Part of what you're
agreeing to is not realising

501
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,390
you've been put in this state.

502
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,790
If you follow me. You won't
recall this conversation.

503
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,030
That's kind of funny, man.

504
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,630
Turn it off.

505
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,990
- So for you to register consent...
- Turn it off, man.

506
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,750
I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.

507
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,110
- Right here?
- Yes, please.

508
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,910
That's dope.

509
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,790
I didn't do that!

510
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,550
- I don't remember that!
- Just like the man said.

511
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,190
- I know you're upset.
- Fuck you!

512
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,070
- What's happening?
- We control what you see, Stripe.

513
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,270
- I can't see nothing.
- Because we control it.

514
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,870
Give me my fucking eyes back.

515
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,550
- Let me lay out your options.
- Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

516
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,830
Let me lay out your options!

517
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,030
Option one, you agree
to have your Mass reset.

518
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,190
All the recollections
of the past few days,

519
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,550
including this conversation, erased.

520
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,030
No way.

521
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,950
Option two's incarceration.

522
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,990
- I'd advise you to consider.
- Fuck you!

523
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,750
Mass is a friend.

524
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,990
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

525
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,870
I ain't having this Mass shit.

526
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,790
No more. No way.

527
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,990
Okay.

528
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,950
Well...

529
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,270
Maybe you should see what
life would be like without it.

530
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,750
What's happening?

531
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,390
Where am I?

532
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,710
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

533
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:59,430
I have it all logged, Stripe. We
can feed you everything that you did.

534
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,910
Hey, no, no, no. No.

535
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,990
Please! Please don't shoot.
Please! Please! Please don't shoot.

536
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,110
- Please! Please!
- No! No!

537
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:13,750
No. Make it stop.

538
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,790
No! Please.

539
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:17,750
Make it stop!

540
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:20,790
Please!

541
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,750
No! No!

542
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,030
No!

543
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,390
Fuck off! Stop it!

544
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,750
No!

545
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:02,270
You'll see and smell and feel it all.

546
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,310
Is this what you want?

547
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:10,950
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

548
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,750
We can make that go away.

549
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,510
This conversation goes away too.

550
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,790
All of it.

551
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,070
But you gotta say the word.

552
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,230
Just say the word, Stripe.

553
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,110
And it all goes away.

554
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,390
Just say the word.

555
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:54,331
