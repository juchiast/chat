I didn't see him, Mia.

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,000
Fuck!

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
Fucking hell, man.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,920
Rob, we've gotta go and look.

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,680
- Oh, my gosh, Rob.
- Hey.

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,000
It's all right, baby.

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160
Oh, my God...

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,840
- Fucking...
- Oh, my God!

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,840
Fuck.

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
Rob, we've gotta call someone.

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,960
No, no, no, no, no, no. Fucking
hell, Mia. Think, OK, hey?

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,640
You need to think, baby.

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
- We've been fucking caning it, yeah?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,800
And I...

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,000
This is prison, yeah? A
fucking instant prison.

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
I've got fuck knows how much
drink in me, I fucking hit a guy.

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,520
Now, they will put me in the
cell. I'm the driver, they'll fu...

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,040
They'll put me in a cell
and fucking keep me there.

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,760
- That's what they'll fucking...
- We can't just leave him here.

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,760
- Shut the fuck up, Mia! Shut...
- And just leave him here in the road?!

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,000
- I need to fucking think, OK?
- I need to think.

36
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Fuck!

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,720
OK, there's, there's a lake over there.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,600
And there's a sleeping bag in the
boot. You keep an eye on the road!

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,160
- No.
- Keep an eye on the road!

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
No.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
No!

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
- Mia.
- Don't.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,440
Mia, come on. Get the
bag with me. Get the bag.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
- No. No, get off.
- Baby, come on.

45
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
Fuck.

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,120
You get the fucking
rocks, I'll stack them, OK?

47
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,160
I need more fucking rocks.

48
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,280
Just put a pile, put
the fucking pile there.

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,200
Put the pile...

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,240
Close it up. Close it up.
Close his head. Close his head.

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
Three...

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
two...

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
one.

54
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,560
Um, it's an honor to
be speaking here today

55
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,600
amongst such impressive company.

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,360
Uh, I'm thrilled to have been shared...

57
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,027
I'm thrilled to have been asked

58
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,920
to share my vision of
the future, such as it is.

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Looking around at a world
of injustice, intolerance

60
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,320
and huge environmental challenges,

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,080
it's hard to imagine a bright
future, but we can and we must.

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,240
It's the only way that we
can build a better tomorrow.

63
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
Um...

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
So I'll start with a funny story.

65
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,720
Right. I'm off.

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,800
Bye-bye.

67
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,040
- See you later on.
- See you tomorrow.

68
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,400
OK.

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,280
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

70
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,920
- Bye, Mom!
- There we go.

71
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,440
Hiya, puppy.

72
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
One moment.

73
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Coming!

74
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,400
Just a second!

75
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,280
- Mrs. Carmichael?
- Yes?

76
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm here on behalf of Realm Insurance.

77
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,640
Just need to log your
recollections about the accident.

78
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,200
- Am I all right to come in?
- Uh, OK then.

79
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,560
Someone who has risen to become

80
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,080
one of the most innovative
architects of her generation.

81
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Not just an architect of
buildings, but communities.

82
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,360
But enough of me telling you about
her. Please welcome Mia Nolan.

83
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,280
Thank you, Martin. Thanks. It's
an honor to be speaking here

84
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,840
amongst such impressive company.

85
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,200
Good evening, welcome to Fences Pizza.

86
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,080
Your pizza is ready for collection.

87
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,600
Hello?

88
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,200
- It's me.
- Hey. Hey.

89
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,920
- Did your chin catch Dutch fur disease?
- Yeah, fuck you.

90
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,240
I didn't say I didn't like it. Come in.

91
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
What's it been? It's been
like two years now, hasn't it?

92
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,000
Uh, three.

93
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,840
Dropping in on my hotel
room, it must be important.

94
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
- Shall we find somewhere to eat?
- Yeah, well, I...

95
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
I got in touch 'cause I
saw that you were in town

96
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,000
for what is it, some,
some architecture thing?

97
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,720
It's a forum, they call it.

98
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
People actually pay to
come and listen to me talk.

99
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Imagine that.

100
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
Almost does my head in.

101
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,520
And you're looking
good. Is that the gym?

102
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Well, you look...

103
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,240
I look like dog shit, Mia.
I'll save you the bother.

104
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
Dried-up dog shit.

105
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,880
- Do you want a drink?
- I knocked it on the head.

106
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
What, you quit, like fully quit?

107
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,480
Nine months, three weeks, two days.

108
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,440
Well done. Well, that's great.

109
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,600
You go ahead.

110
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,880
- Really, go on.
- You sure?

111
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,080
- Absolutely.
- OK.

112
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,250
You picked a terrible place

113
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,960
to come see me 'cause it reeks of hops

114
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,960
all the way down the
street outside here.

115
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,960
- Did you notice that?
- No.

116
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,400
It's like a full-on beer smell.

117
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,440
Can't help your sobriety, that.

118
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,760
But I probably shouldn't be
talking about booze, should I?

119
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,000
Rob, I hope you're not
here to talk about what I...

120
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,160
It's about that, yeah.

121
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,720
I've been thinking about
it again, that night.

122
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,520
- Rob.
- I can't not think about it.

123
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,320
We said that we'd put
it out of our minds.

124
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,560
Weren't we just gonna
try and keep it out?

125
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,160
I can't. I'm sorry.

126
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,840
It was a long time ago.

127
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,360
Well, in here, it's now.

128
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,120
Yeah, I know.

129
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,120
Why today? Why is it
preying on your mind today?

130
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,320
- There's a news story.
- A news story?

131
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,480
Uh, a featured article.
Well, whatever you call it.

132
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,240
I printed it for you.

133
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Mia?

134
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,120
That... That's her. It's his wife.

135
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,960
- You don't know that's his wife.
- There is a photo of him at the bottom.

136
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
It's him.

137
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,040
And the poor cunt, they never found him.

138
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,200
So she never remarried.

139
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,920
She never fucking moved house.

140
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,880
She stayed where she
is in case he came back.

141
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,760
All this time, Mia, she's
still waiting for him.

142
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,200
That's dreadful. But what can we do?

143
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm gonna write her a letter.

144
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
- No.
- Anonymous.

145
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,080
- I am not gonna mention you.
- Rob, no.

146
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,680
You'll open up God knows what,
you'll just rake it all up.

147
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,400
- I can't live with it, Mia.
- There's things they can do.

148
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,000
'Cause they can trace it back.

149
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,161
They can trace it. They'll
find the body, they'll find us.

150
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
- They won't find us.
- Yes, they will, then we're fucked.

151
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,600
Look, when I quit alcohol,

152
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,920
they told me to make amends
with anyone I've ever hurt.

153
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,560
Who have I hurt more than her?

154
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,160
Also say you're not supposed to
hurt anyone else. What about me?

155
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
- What about her?
- No, no, no.

156
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,480
No.

157
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,960
No! Fuck!

158
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,120
It was your idea. It
was your fucking idea!

159
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,760
I know. I know, and I'm sorry.

160
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Fifteen years, 15 years, the
fucking shame, the fucking guilt!

161
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,200
I've got somewhere. I've got a life.
You don't know, don't understand.

162
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,080
That's not the point, though.

163
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,640
You don't understand.

164
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,280
You're not married. I've got
a son. He's nine years old.

165
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,440
You've seen photos of
him. Think of him, please.

166
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,280
I sat on this for you.

168
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,080
- I fucking sat on this for you!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

169
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,320
Hey, look at me.

170
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,400
Look at me.

171
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,240
I've made up my mind,
and that's how it is.

172
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,640
Please, please, please.

173
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,760
Please, please, please, Rob. Hey,
listen, I understand. I understand.

174
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,840
Do you?

175
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,200
Yeah. Come on, let's talk about this.

176
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,160
No, no, I can't stay here.

177
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,840
- No, no, no, no.
- What are you doing? Let go!

178
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,520
Mia, I'm fucking leaving.

179
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600
What are you doing?

180
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,160
Mia, let the... Mia, let the
fuck... Let the fuck... go!

181
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
Fuck...

182
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,640
Ah!

183
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
Huh?

184
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,360
Codger.

185
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,920
That's his name, Codger.

186
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
What?

187
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
- Ah, you don't like him.
- Oh, it's not that.

188
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,560
- It's so hard to get presents for you.
- No, I like him. He's... fluffy.

189
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Exactly. No, Ali's gonna love him.

190
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,480
It's just we've got a lot
going on, what with Ali and...

191
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,360
I'll take him back. The pet shop
guy was OK. It won't be a problem.

192
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,920
No, no, no, no, you're
right. It'll be good for Ali.

193
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,080
Codger stays.

194
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,480
He's... Codger the lodger.

195
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
Changing time. Uh...

196
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,080
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

197
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,160
Room service.

198
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,160
Lovely, thank you.

199
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,840
Hi. Hiya, love.

200
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,280
Yeah, it was... No,
the speech went great.

201
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,240
Yeah, I'm back in the morning.

202
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
I'm just tired, that's all.

203
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,640
Um...

204
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,040
Did he? Oh, that's great.

205
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,480
No, don't put him on.

206
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Hi, hey.

207
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,760
Hey, Dad said you were great
in your rehearsal for your play.

208
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,600
You had a good rehearsal?
Yeah, I'm proud of you.

209
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Yeah.

210
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I love you.

211
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,200
So that's one night.

212
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,120
You had room service and a
ã9.99 charge for the movie.

213
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,800
For a movie?

214
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,520
You... you watched
a film last night, no?

215
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,280
Yeah. I was in last night, yeah.

216
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,400
Thanks.

217
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
Thank you.

218
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,640
I'm from Realm Insurance,
about the pizza van accident.

219
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,840
Oh, come in.

220
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I mean,

221
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,703
it'll cover you for up to four months,

222
00:22:57,704 --> 00:22:59,720
but that is quite a substantial claim.

223
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,520
Well, I was heading off on tour
with the Philharmonic next week.

224
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,880
Europe, Middle East, Australia.

225
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,520
- Not now.
- Mm.

226
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,280
As I'm sure you appreciate,
with a payout of this size,

227
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,640
- we will need to investigate the accident.
- Yeah, of course.

228
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,680
Now, that stretch of the street
has a security camera, vandalized,

229
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,600
by some kids, I'm guessing,
paintballed right in the wrong place.

230
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,080
But the, um...

231
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,280
delivery van thing must've had a camera.

232
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
- Not working.
- Oh, for God's sake.

233
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
No, that's actually good for your
claim. Fences Pizza's a big company.

234
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
They've been claiming their
driverless fleet has a good record.

235
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,240
The malfunctioning camera,
that's a step toward negligence.

236
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,640
So if we can prove full liability,
you could also consider filing

237
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,080
a substantial civil case
under our litigation wing?

238
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,000
Could be a lot of money.

239
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,280
Yeah, OK, I'm sold.

240
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,520
Great.

241
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,680
Now, I'll just hook you up

242
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,360
to the recaller here.

243
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
It's one of those memory dredgers?

244
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,800
We prefer "corroborators."

245
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,240
- Police things, aren't they?
- Mm... Not since last year.

246
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,920
We all have them now.

247
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,350
Right.

248
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,040
- May I?
- Yeah.

249
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,600
I feel like a specimen.

250
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,720
So, this accesses engrams,
your memories of what happened.

251
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,560
Now, they're subjective.

252
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,240
They may not be totally accurate,
and they're often emotional,

253
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,140
but by collecting a
range of recollections

254
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,760
from yourself and any witnesses,

255
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,160
we can help build a corroborative
picture of the whole.

256
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,400
I don't remember anything.
It's a total blank.

257
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,520
Oh, I've got something that might help.

258
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
What, getting drunk?

259
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,620
The accident happened

260
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,560
a few hundred meters from
the Castle Port Brewery.

261
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,320
The whole area smells like a pub.

262
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,960
No sipping, just take a sniff.

263
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,440
Aroma's a great memory
boost, helps anchor you

264
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,840
to where you were.

265
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,120
Oh... that's familiar.

266
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,810
OK. Now, hold that smell in your mind,

267
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:12,160
close your eyes and picture the street.

268
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,240
Getting something now.

269
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,080
Yeah. I went to a sort of comic shop...

270
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,240
Culty stuff. Um...

271
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
I think it started
snowing when I came out.

272
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,880
Heavy snow, um...

273
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,800
There was music from a car.

274
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,280
I like that song.

275
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,800
There was a woman in a
yellow coat coming towards me.

276
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,520
Good recall on her face.

277
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,680
She had this weird
lipstick on. It stood out.

278
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,160
And she's pretty.

279
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,520
Um, yeah, yeah, and that, too.

280
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,467
Well, the more emotional your response,

281
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:07,640
the more vivid your memory of it is.

282
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,320
So there was the music and a
girl, and then what happened?

283
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,171
Well, I went to cross the road,

284
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:19,080
wasn't really thinking about anything,

285
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,360
and, uh...

286
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,320
And that's just when it just goes. Um...

287
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,320
That's OK. What you've
given me is already useful.

288
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,880
Really?

289
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,480
Well, I've got someone to look
for, Little Miss Yellow Coat.

290
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,680
- Hey.
- Ah, the wanderer returns.

291
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,520
- Yeah.
- You don't know how to fix this, do you?

292
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,200
Um, yeah, I'll have a look at it later.

293
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,280
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, you.

294
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,960
Tonight's the big night.

295
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,920
♪ We coulda been anything ♪
♪ That we wanted to be ♪

296
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Dad!

297
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,920
School musical, Bugsy Malone.

298
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,280
You all right?

299
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Yeah. Yeah.

300
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,120
They've got this, um, sound
system for the backing tracks

301
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,280
that they can't work out
and I said I'd help them out.

302
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,920
So... I'm gonna be there all day.

303
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,200
You're gonna die of
loneliness here, are you?

304
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,640
Yeah, I'll be fine.

305
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
Well, we'll see you later, 7:30.

306
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't forget.

307
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
I won't.

308
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,680
- See ya.
- See you later.

309
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,800
Bye.

310
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,120
It was only yesterday. You're efficient.

311
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,680
The fresher the memory,
the stronger it is,

312
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,480
and the stronger the memory,
the stronger the case.

313
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,200
I'll also just get you
to take a sniff of this.

314
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,720
God knows what they
think we're doing in here.

315
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,880
If you close your eyes, I'm
also gonna play a piece of music.

316
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,640
God, yeah, yeah, that, that was on.

317
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,280
How weird.

318
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,160
Hold those things in your
mind and picture what you saw.

319
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,600
I was on Stanhope Road,
near the hotel place,

320
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,720
looking at flats and stuff,
you know, window shopping.

321
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,600
I saw this guy walking towards me.

322
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,240
I remember thinking he
looked sort of sweet.

323
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,440
The music was coming from
the car, which pulled off.

324
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,320
Actually that was when the
delivery thing drove past.

325
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,040
Fences Pizza? What sort
of speed was it going?

326
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,880
You mean, was it going too fast?

327
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
Um...

328
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,760
- Try and focus on the vehicle.
- Maybe.

329
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,440
Um...

330
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Um...

331
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,360
I don't know. I couldn't really say.

332
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,640
What about the impact itself?

333
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,360
Well, I didn't really see it. I
just saw the aftermath, really.

334
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,040
A moment earlier you saw a bright light?

335
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah. Like a camera flash just before.

336
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Just outside the dentist place.

337
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,840
Hmm.

338
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,920
And I'm assuming your
window glazing's soundproof.

339
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,600
- Yes, we get the odd screamer.
- I won't bother with the music then.

340
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,040
Look, to be honest, the
memory's a bit embarrassing...

341
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,520
- Don't worry, I've seen it all.
- Do you have to use that thing?

342
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,080
Look, your memories will
be sealed and private.

343
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,000
Unless they indicate you're
harming yourself or another person.

344
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,640
Go on then.

345
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,880
I'd had a patient.

346
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,840
Hmm, so I see.

347
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,880
She left around six, I think.

348
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,240
I stayed to clear up.

349
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,680
You saw something from the window?

350
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,440
There was a guy in the hotel window.

351
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Well, what can I say?

352
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,000
He was picturesque.

353
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,680
Did you take a photo?

354
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,120
Well, I tried to.

355
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,040
I left the flash on by mistake,
so all I got was the reflection.

356
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,920
- And then?
- I was going to take another one.

357
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,880
I saw some woman staring at something.

358
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,800
So I looked down, it was
just a load of commotion.

359
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,160
There was a woman in
a sort of lime coat.

360
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,520
Hmm, yellow actually.

361
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,720
- Well, I knew it was vivid.
- Well, memories can be subjective.

362
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,693
What we do is build
up an overall average,

363
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:39,600
a crowd-sourced picture of reality.

364
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,200
Did you see the vehicle
that hit the pedestrian?

365
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,680
Any sense of its speed?

366
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,120
I didn't see the actual crash, sorry.

367
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,560
OK.

368
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,040
You won't tell anyone about the photo?

369
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,800
Don't need to put that in my report.

370
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,680
It's safe with me.

371
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,040
That'd be room 304.

372
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,800
Can you tell me who stayed there?

373
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,720
- You're not the police?
- No, but...

374
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,200
Then you'd have to lodge for
an information request for that.

375
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,200
But that could take up
to a week to process.

376
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,560
Sorry, management's an ass
about it ever since that thing

377
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,600
with what's-his-name,
the judge of Hot Shots?

378
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,440
Anyway, he got caught with a rent
boy and, um, a tabloid got his name

379
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
by hacking our booking system, and yeah,

380
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,640
they're tight as anything
about the rule now.

381
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,840
Oh, the woman I'm after
hasn't done anything.

382
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,040
I just think she might
have seen something outside

383
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,960
yesterday evening about 6:30.

384
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,080
Oh, I can...

385
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,812
I can tell you that
she wasn't outside...

386
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:54,640
and I know what she was looking at.

387
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,440
How so?

388
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,280
I can't tell you who she is but,
um, she's into interesting films.

389
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,440
We log the in-house movies
that people watch and, um...

390
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,680
her choice stood out.

391
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,320
Oh.

392
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,320
How nice for her. Thanks.

393
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,560
Oh, bless you.

394
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
How's the pizza accident going?

395
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,920
Hmm. A pain in the ass.

396
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,740
Can't pinpoint liability

397
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,560
'cause no one agrees on the
speed of the bloody thing

398
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,240
and I can't find anyone
who actually saw the impact.

399
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,160
Well, not yet.

400
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Except maybe smudge face
here, whoever she is.

401
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,400
Oh, bingo.

402
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,640
Mia Nolan. You might be
the one, if you'll talk.

403
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,840
What, if she'll talk?

404
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,080
She was doing something
embarrassing in the hotel room,

405
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,960
watching a porn film.

406
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,480
She might not want me
poking around in her head.

407
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,680
She's, like, 50 miles out of town.
Do you mind if I head there now?

408
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,360
It's a bit late.

409
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,680
Oh, if I sew this up in 24
hours, I get two times bonus.

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Well...

411
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,200
Go. Go.

412
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,880
♪ I know I won't ever let you go ♪

413
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,640

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,840

415

417
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,320
Hi, I'm Shazia. I'm
from Realm Insurance.

418
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,720
- I've already got insurance, thanks.
- I'm not selling anything.

419
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,560
I'm following up on an incident
you might've seen, a road accident.

420
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
I don't know anything about an accident.

421
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,160
This was only yesterday.

422
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,320
- An accident?
- On Stanhope Road.

423
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,520
Medina Plaza Hotel, a pedestrian
was hit by a delivery vehicle,

424
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,520
Fences Pizza, driverless.

425
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,000
Um...

426
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,760
Right, yeah. I'm sorry, actually I did.

427
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,920
When you first mentioned it,

428
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:03,680
I just didn't think of
it, but um... yeah, I did.

429
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,200
So you saw what happened?

430
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,880
Uh, yeah, there was a
guy crossing the street

431
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,200
and this little van thing sort
of just clipped him, it was quick.

432
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,405
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions about it?

433
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:15,400
It won't take long.

434
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm sorry, I'm really busy. I've got...

435
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,214
I don't wanna sound heavy

436
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,720
but it's a legal
requirement since last year.

437
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
It's a legal requirement?

438
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,440
Well, if you've witnessed
an incident, yes.

439
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,240
I have to notify the
police when people refuse,

440
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,680
and when they get involved, it
just drags everything out, so...

441
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,480
- Come in.
- Thank you.

442
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,040
Yeah, just that way.

443
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
OK.

444
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,080
- What does that do?
- The recaller?

445
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,400
Just helps me get a
record of what happened.

446
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,480
May I?

447
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,920
Well, I can just tell you
what happened. I can remember.

448
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,560
The van hit the guy, and he fell
over, and then people came to help.

449
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,120
How fast was it going
though, the delivery vehicle?

450
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Um...

451
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,640
See, I just need a sense of that.

452
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,320
It's sometimes hard to articulate
what your mind's eye's seen,

453
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,080
but capturing your impression
of what you saw is really useful.

454
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,600
- OK, but I've got...
- And that's all I'm interested in.

455
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
You can read the terms here if you like.

456
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,520
All the legal stuff is in there.

457
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,108
Look, I don't care what
you might've been doing

458
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,760
in the hotel room in your own time.

459
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,520
I'm not gonna ask you anything
about that. Won't go there.

460
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,120
- OK.
- Private stuff is private stuff.

461
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,680
- So it's just the accident?
- Just that.

462
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
It's a bit of a long read, isn't it?

463
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,400
- Do you want a tea or a coffee?
- Oh, a coffee would be great.

464
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,360
- Yeah, OK. Espresso?
- Perfect.

465
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,597
Do you mind if I just go and have a pee

466
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:44,960
if I'm gonna be sat down a while?

467
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,920
- Yeah, sure.
- OK.

468
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,840
I ate hotel food, I had room service.

469
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,120
I ate room service.

470
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,160
I was in the hotel room on my own.

471
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Watched porn.

472
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,600
Watched porn.

473
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,760
Saw the accident.

474
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,840
Come on, focus.

475
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,000
I was on my own.

476
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,040
I was on my own.

477
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,120
I was on my own.

478
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,840
There you go.

479
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,200
Take a sniff.

480
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,560
- What's that for?
- It'll just help your recall.

481
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,560
That's it.

482
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,040
The music will help
jog your memory, too.

483
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
OK, close your eyes.

484
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,120
OK, let's start with
you in your hotel room.

485
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,920
♪ You can blame me ♪
♪ Try to shame me... ♪

486
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000

I ordered room service.

00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,720
♪ ... care for you ♪

488
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,400
All I need is the accident.

489
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,560
Try to picture the moments
leading up to the impact.

490
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,840
♪ Anyone ♪

491
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,520

492
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,040
The fucking shame, the fucking guilt...

493
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,800
No.

494
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,080
No!

495
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,600
- I sat on this...
- Get the fuck off me fucking...

496
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,760
Well, that's... great.

497
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,600
Got what I needed on
the van, so, I'll be off.

498
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
OK.

499
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,880
That's it.

500
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
- So you've got everything you needed?
- Yeah.

501
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,600
Doesn't take long, it's just a
simple thing with the speed so...

502
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,880
- Right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,760
Sorry about being short,
it's been a long day.

504
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,880
- No, it's fine.
- Got a lot of work on. Did you...

505
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,880
- So you've got everything you needed?
- Yeah, yeah, got it all.

506
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,360
- Don't worry, thank you so much.
- I know this sounds silly,

507
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,022
but, um, you know, sometimes
I just think mad things,

508
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:33,160
and it doesn't mean anything,

509
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,880
do you know what I mean? When
you have strange thoughts.

510
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,240
No, it's fine, like I said. I
got what I needed, so thank you.

511
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,480
Yeah, but do you know what I mean?
It's not like... it's just my head.

512
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,600
Come on!

513
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,600
No.

514
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,040
No, no, no, no! No!

515
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,200
No!

516
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,240
I'm sorry, um...

517
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,680
Um...

518
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,440
I fucked up, and I panicked.

519
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,920
Does your head hurt?

520
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,120
OK.

521
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,880
OK.

522
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,840
What am I gonna do with you?

523
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,960
I mean, I can't let you go.

524
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,680
You're gonna tell someone, aren't you?

525
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,183
I know, but even if you say you won't,

526
00:45:30,184 --> 00:45:32,480
your recollections are all recorded.

527
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,760
- I won't.
- They're not?

528
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,000
No.

529
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,960
If I take that off your mouth,
will you promise not to scream?

530
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,080
Do you promise?

531
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,692
Forget the report. I'll delete...

532
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:48,720
I'll delete it, it won't go anywhere.

533
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,640
I don't know. I tried to delete
it, and I couldn't figure it out.

534
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,600
I won't say anything to anyone, I
promise. I'll forget the whole thing.

535
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,040
No one will know. I won't say anything.

536
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,880
I wish I believed you.

537
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,880
I mean it. I mean it. I've seen things.

538
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,520
I've seen things on the recaller.

539
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,600
Secrets, personal things,
I've never spilled any of it.

540
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,640
I'm not allowed to, it's the law.

541
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,280
It's like confession, it's
like Catholic confession.

542
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,814
It'll be illegal for me to say anything.

543
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:20,480
Totally illegal, even if I wanted to!

544
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,480
None of that's true, is it?

545
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,480
- It is, I swear.
- It's not.

546
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,800
It is.

547
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,560
Did you tell anyone that
you were coming here today?

548
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,960
No.

549
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,120
- You're lying.
- I'm not. I swear I'm not lying.

550
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,040
No, I swear.

551
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,560
I swear. No!

552
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,480
No!

553
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,920
No!

No!

you came here today?

Bingo.

Mia Nolan, if she'll talk.

563
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640

- No!

No.

Yeah, please, make sure you're on time.

574
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,000

- I'm gonna make it, 7:30.

575
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,120
- At 7:30.
- Yeah.

- See you in a bit, sweetheart.
- OK.

578
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,320
- Cutting it a bit fine.
- Yeah, it was just work stuff.

579
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,240
Jesus, what'd you eat, a vineyard?

580
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,440
No, I just finished the
design so had a glass of wine.

581
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,000

I don't know.

597
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,040
Probably someone worried
about leaving a witness.

598
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,480
Bloodbath upstairs and this downstairs.

599
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,800
But he couldn't see.

600

Poor fucker was born blind apparently.

no idea who I'm looking for.
