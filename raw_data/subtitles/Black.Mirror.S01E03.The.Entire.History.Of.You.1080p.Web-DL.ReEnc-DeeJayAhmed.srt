1
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:22,738
Liam Foxwell, welcome.

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,056
Thank you.

3
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,575
OK, little speech time.

4
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:28,306
I've mentioned this to
everyone about their appraisals,

5
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:32,052
and I just want you to know that this
isn't a witch-hunt for the deadwood.

6
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:33,692
It is much more of a...

7
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:37,146
treasure hunt for the gold?

8
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,324
Shit sinks.

9
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,106
But also, cream floats.

10
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,868
Yes, yes, I see that.

11
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,683
A new the area we're
getting lots of play in...

12
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:48,107
and your office could
be at the centre for...

13
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,546
is litigation in
retrospective parenting cases.

14
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:52,833
Retrospective...

15
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,659
Bobby sues Mum and Dad
for insufficient attention

16
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:59,472
leading to lack of confidence,
leading to damages against earnings.

17
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:03,385
Right, and we're OK,
the firm's OK with that, ethically?

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,906
And morally?

19
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:09,640
Yep.

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,746
Sure.

21
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:13,558
Yeah, yeah, right.

22
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:15,219
Are you?

23
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:17,259
Totally, yeah.

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,306
Yes.

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,123
OK, Liam, look,

26
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,760
so if we invite you to stay with
the firm in the new environment,

27
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:29,943
what we'd have you do is
pull an exhaustive redo

28
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:32,015
with personnel, maybe... next week.

29
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:35,466
Well, I was ready to do
a big redo right now, but...

30
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,646
No, it's fine, next week's fine.

31
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:41,491
But I have to ask you this...
they're not going to hit anything

32
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:43,456
to freak us out, are they?

33
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,332
There's no major
deletions this quarter?

34
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,316
No, no, everything's
well within... parameters.

35
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:53,088
Great, OK, Liam,
this has been really great.

36
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:59,916
Look, really hope to... look
forward to seeing you again.

37
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:05,863
OK, thank you.

38
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,145
Airport, please.

39
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,511
'Live...

40
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:30,779

00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:12,388

this has been really great, Liam,

we really hope to... look forward

We really hope to... look forward
to seeing you again.

49
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:35,243
Sorry!

50
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,233
Mr Foxwell.

51
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:54,022
Could you just rewind me
your last 24 hours for me, please?

52
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:06,178
Great, and back that up for me
times 64 for the week.

53
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:13,828
That's great.

54
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,555
Enjoy your flight, Mr Foxwell.

55
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,696
I'm not being funny,
right, but look at that.

56
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,258
Look at what?

57
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,568
That!

58
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,105
Frayed carpet, there, you see?

59
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:29,412
Seriously?

60
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,026
Yes, seriously!

61
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:33,188
This is a five-star suite.

62
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,044
I pay good money
to have perfect details.

63
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:40,148
Now I've got that shitty
carpet for the rest of my life.

64
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,228
Only if you keep looking at it,
mate.

65
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,129
Thanks, Jonas!

66
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,597
Fuck off.

67
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,203
All right, now, you thought the
carpet was bad, have a look at this.

68
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:59,226
You've met Lucy, my wife,
at the Dublin wedding?

69
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,242
That's right, yes, hi, Liam.

70
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,194
Hi... Hi again.

71
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:09,161
Hello.

72
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:11,698
Lucy... Liam,
we met at the Dublin wedding.

73
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:13,268
Liam!

74
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,574
Great.

75
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,148
Liam, yes.

76
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:17,908
Come in.
Thank you.

77
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:22,362
- Great to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

78
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,788
Where's Fi been hiding you?

79
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:27,706
You know, in our house.

80
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:31,931
We didn't know... well, she didn't
know if you would make it.

81
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:33,784
It was over quicker than I thought.

82
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,529
Sorry, hello.

83
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:39,498
Let's get you a drink.
Beer OK?

84
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,202
Lovely, thank you.

85
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,363
Everyone's through there,
so I'll be in in a minute, OK?

86
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,483
OK, thank you.

87
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:00,788
Hi.

88
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:05,412
You're back early, then,
I didn't think you'd make it.

89
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:09,093
Yeah, I didn't stay over and I
caught an early flight back, so...

90
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:10,502
- Hi.
- Hello.

91
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,424
So, how was the appraisal?

92
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:16,988
Well, they said they'd let me do
a redo sometime next week, so...

93
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,716
But good?

94
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:20,190
Well...

95
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,254
- Later?
- Later.

96
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,275
OK.

97
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:26,403
- How's Jody?
- At home, Gina's babysitting.

98
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:27,835
Hey.

99
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,103
Jonas, this is...

100
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:31,126
- Liam...
- Jonas.

101
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:33,148
Dude, it's really nice to meet you.

102
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,348
- You all right?
- Good, thank you.

103
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,020
- And you know Jeff?
- Yes.

104
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:40,153
Yeah, you remember meeting Jeff,
because he'd have shown you,

105
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,147
I don't know, a redo
of the side of his fridge.

106
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:45,163
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
piss off, Jonas.

107
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,493
- Hello.
- Hello.

108
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,645
Your wife's being
very mean to me tonight.

109
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,868
Well she's like that.

110
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,275
Yeah, tell me about it.

111
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:54,782
- You all right for a drink?
- I'm fine, thank you, Jonas.

112
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,994
Lynn, come and meet Liam, he's...

113
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:03,308
A soon-to-be
unemployed/unemployable lawyer.

114
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:07,294
And Jeff.

115
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:09,632
Jeff and Fi...

116
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:13,108
used to run the parties down
the Fraser Road with Paul and me.

117
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:14,894
Mad old days.

118
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:17,586
Before we started up the Kings.

119
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,506
So, yeah...

120
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:26,304
So, Liam, what was it you had,
an assessment?

121
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,631
Appraisal.

122
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:28,908
How'd it go?

123
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,306
Good.

124
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:34,542
Well, it was a disaster,
but you know, I don't know.

125
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,901
- Hard to gauge?
- Yeah

126
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,194
Let's have a look.

127
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,409
Redo, we can
appraise the appraisal.

128
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:41,946
Yeah, great.

129
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:44,080
Throw it up there
and we can grade you.

130
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,219
Come on...

131
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:48,346
It could be fun, we could...

132
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:49,396
vote!

133
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:51,554
- Paul?
- Yeah?

134
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:54,664
I work in recruitment,
so it might be quite useful for you.

135
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,270
Right, OK.

136
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,944
Liam's redoing his
appraisal so we can give him marks.

137
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,066
- Notes.
- Pointers, you know.

138
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,348
- I think Liam would probably...
- Yes, do you know what...

139
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,512
Guys, no, come on,
seriously, that's not cool,

140
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:07,988
I mean Liam's
obviously uncomfortable,

141
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,268
so let's just drop it, yeah?

142
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:12,609
Have a cool time.

143
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:15,788
Time to eat!

144
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,235
It's ready.

145
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:23,493
Thank you so much
for inviting us this evening.

146
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:26,341
It's been too long, too long.

147
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:28,187
Fi.

148
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:32,978
I haven't met him before, have I?
Jonas, is it?

149
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:34,709
He's one of the old crowd.

150
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,300
I think I said.

151
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,247
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

152
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,549
- You know, if you're not in the mood,
we can go. - No, no, I'm fine.

153
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:43,582
Sure?

154
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:04,287
Hey!

155
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Sync and corrected by APOLLO Resync
for WEB-DL by Darleg www.addic7ed.com

156
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:24,240
Yeah! I brought enough
for others to share.

157
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:25,401
Thank you.

158
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:28,561
I've, been cooking a lot
since the break-up.

159
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,481
Jonas has had a tough one.

160
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:32,961
Was it bad?

161
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:35,202
Yeah.

162
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:38,037
Yeah, we were in the middle
of planning is all

163
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:42,215
and I suddenly realised that
the less the relationship means

164
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,235
the more you spend
on the wedding, you know!

165
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:47,801
You actually start obsessing over
the tiniest little details,

166
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:50,841
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper

167
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:55,102
because, I mean, God knows you need
something to fucking talk about!

168
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:57,979
So, everybody, this is Helen.

169
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:00,354
Helen, Jonas.

170
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,877
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,963
And everyone!

172
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,637
- Hi!
- Help yourself.

173
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:09,561
Jonas was just explaining why
relationships are a sham.

174
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:11,161
Are they? Shit!

175
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:14,264
They're like going
to the theatre, OK?

176
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,521
You pay loads to go and ultimately
you are wasting your entire night,

177
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:21,641
so, when someone asks you,
"Did you have a good time?",

178
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:25,641
you both say,
"Yeah! Yeah, it was great."

179
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,789
The problem is the
more that you pay

180
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:32,001
and the longer it goes on, the more
you're, "Yeah, we loved it!",

181
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:35,801
you know, "We love being together
and never fucking anyone else"

182
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,879
"and only just having
one other person"

183
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:43,197
"to share our real thoughts with for
our entire lives, yeah, it's great!"

184
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,314
Would you say you loved her, though?

185
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,187
I just think we just really fancied
each other and that was what it was.

186
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,625
You know what it's like early on.

187
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,761
You know, we were just,
I don't know,

188
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:58,921
we were just two tools
in the tool shed

189
00:10:58,922 --> 00:11:00,641
that just fit together
really fucking well.

190
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:05,277
I mean, still, by the end, I'd
be like, "Go on, honey, you go up,"

191
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,481
"I'm just going to watch
a little bit more of the news"

192
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:10,080
and I'd find myself, you know,
watching redos of, like,

193
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,201
hot times in earlier relationships!

194
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:13,514
Easy!

195
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:16,930
I'm just saying, there's
a beautiful woman upstairs,

196
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:18,326
you know, waiting
to have sex with me.

197
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,588
What, right now?

198
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:26,241
She's upstairs, you know,
waiting to have sex with me

199
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:30,241
and I'm sat downstairs watching
redos of, like, some hot times

200
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:34,114
with some hot girl that I just
picked up in some place

201
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:38,032
and I'm fucking pulling
myself off. I mean, seriously?

202
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,093
Come on...

203
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:44,761
Come on, guys.

204
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,521
I mean, we all scroll
through the Grain

205
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,121
rifling through our greatest hits

206
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:51,197
for a little bit of filth
now and then, surely?

207
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:52,623
Not me.

208
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:56,664
Helen doesn't have a Grain!

209
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,221
No shit!

210
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:03,521
Was that a political thing?

211
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,041
No, no, I was gouged
about 12 months ago.

212
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,521
Jesus, was that painful?

213
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,761
Total agony.

214
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,561
But on the plus of that, I don't
remember it that clearly.

215
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,081
There's a scar on here.

216
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,516
Yeah, can I...?

217
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,481
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

218
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:35,281
Yeah, no brain damage, clearly!

219
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:38,539
Well, my sight held on fine, so...

220
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:40,361
So, who took it then?

221
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:42,681
Stolen to order,
as far as they could tell,

222
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:46,041
probably to some millionaire
Chinese perve.

223
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,641
Really?! Yeah.

224
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,321
Is that for real?

225
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:51,401
Yeah, and none of
it was encrypted, so...

226
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,401
So, they saw the lot!

227
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:56,670
The thing is, after I was gouged
I didn't have one for a few days

228
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,652
and then just kind of, liked it.

229
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:03,881
It's cool.

230
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:04,961
That's cool.

231
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:07,121
I mean, because more people are...

232
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,801
I mean, now, right?
Like, going Grainless?

233
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,241
I believe it's huge with hookers.

234
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:12,921
I mean, no offence!

235
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,761
No, no, it's OK. Sure, I...

236
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,979
Well, I'm pretty boring.
One man is a time.

237
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,921
Serial monogamist.

238
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:25,739
I'm a serial monogamist.

239
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:28,481
I'm staying faithful
to my cornflakes right now!

240
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:35,601
Well, I think it's an interesting
choice, going Grainless.

241
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:36,761
It's a brave choice.

242
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:38,519
I'm sorry, but I...

243
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:42,521
I couldn't do it.

244
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:50,561
OK, I was going to play some redos
from the Fraser O days.

245
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:54,401
Stuff from last night,
depressing and fun.

246
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:58,296
You know half the organic
memories you have a junk,

247
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,917
just not trustworthy.

248
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,681
Colleen works in Grain development.

249
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:04,758
With half the population you can
implant false memories,

250
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,108
just by asking leading
questions in therapy.

251
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,632
You can make people
remember getting lost

252
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:11,521
in shopping malls they
never visited,

253
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:14,534
getting bothered by paedophile
babysitters they never had.

254
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,527
I'm just happier now.

255
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:25,601
'OK, great, Liam, this has been,
this has been really great...

256
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:28,320
'we really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

257
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,289
He looks forward to seeing
you again, that's good.

258
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,721
"Hopes" to look forward.

259
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:36,361
'We really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

260
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:37,666
It's phoney.

261
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,326
Hang on.

262
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:41,589
Pause it.

263
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,124
Now backup.

264
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:45,351
Zoom in there.

265
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,641
Come on, that's a tick.

266
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,201
That could be a V or an L.

267
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:51,597
- It's a tick!
- Or the start of the swastika.

268
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:55,013
It's probably the start of the
swastika, they were such pricks!

269
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,557
- Did you have fun with the old gang?
- Yeah.

270
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:06,441
D'you speak to that Jonas much?

271
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:08,298
No, no, not really.

272
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:14,232
He's a bit of a knob, ain't he?

273
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,921
Bit of a dick?

274
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:16,961
Jonas.

275
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:20,521
Pulling himself off to his own
relationship theories.

276
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:23,841
It must be such a drag,
Jonas, putting it about!

277
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:26,561
And when he protected me
from those arseholes,

278
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,401
"Hey, come on, guys,"

279
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:31,081
"it's really not cool to redo
another man's appraisals, dudes."

280
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:32,921
Then why invite him over?

281
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,228
I like him.

282
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:42,601
You wanted me to invite him.

283
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,281
I didn't say anything.

284
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,841
You were laughing
at everything he said.

285
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:49,361
You invited him!

286
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,700
It was obvious
I didn't want him to come.

287
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:57,121
'It's only, it's early
to call it a night.'

288
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,837
'Do fancy a quick one down the pub?'

289
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:00,161
'We've got to get back,

290
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:02,721
'rescue Jodie from
the paedophile babysitter!

291
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:05,600
'Yeah.'

292
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:11,361
'But why don't you come back to
ours, for a nightcap if you want?'

293
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:12,401
See?

294
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:16,658
It was obvious I didn't want him to
come, I was being polite to a moron.

295
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,629
If you really don't want to come,
you can get rid of him.

296
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:32,711
Hey, hey!

297
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,784
Hey.

298
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,614
Well, actually, what time is it?

299
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,132
It's midnight.

300
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,228
Shit, it's quite late,
time's gone on.

301
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:43,245
Yeah, time does that.

302
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,481
15 minutes.

303
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,641
Yeah.

304
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,669
But we've got the babysitter
inside, so...

305
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:50,641
So, is that new info?

306
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,641
No, it's just that we, I mean,
we thought, right, Fi?

307
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:56,721
Yeah. Yeah.

308
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:58,081
OK, no, I get it.

309
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,201
No, it's just that, actually,
it turns out we're tired

310
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:03,241
and I guess we forgot,
but now we've remembered, so...

311
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:04,281
Sorry.

312
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:05,121
No, it's fine, really.

313
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:06,161
I'm sorry.

314
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:08,721
It's cool, no worries.

315
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:10,601
I've got a back-up plan, so...

316
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:12,361
Cool, well, we vote the back-up.

317
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:13,801
Yeah, I will do.

318
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:15,561
See you later, Fi.

319
00:17:15,562 --> 00:17:16,721
It was good to meet you, man.

320
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:17,733
Yeah.

321
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,201
Nice one.

322
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,622
Brilliant. Brilliant.

323
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:24,111
OK, cool.

324
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:29,274
Good to meet you, man.

325
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:30,411
Yeah.

326
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:36,481
Listen, Gina, it's a 40-minute
wait for a cab, but if you want,

327
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,775
I have the bed made up in my office.

328
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,217
OK, thanks, Fi.

329
00:17:41,884 --> 00:17:45,881
Hey, there's just, you know, use
anything. There's T-shirts and...

330
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:47,889
Yeah, thanks, I'll show myself out.

331
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:48,921
All right, night.

332
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:49,961
Night, guys.

333
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:51,275
Night, Gina.

334
00:17:58,522 --> 00:17:59,896
Thank you.

335
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,487
'Bye-bye.

336
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,401
'OK.

337
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:06,669
'Love you, love you.'

338
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,841
Was he a big part of the gang?

339
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,230
Who? Jonas?

340
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:33,126
I don't know, yeah?

341
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:37,241
Let me guess, he'd spent his time
oozing round the girls,

342
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,321
offering backrubs.

343
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:39,601
Not really.

344
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,349
Circling for an orifice.

345
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:45,041
Was he always that oily or...

346
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,348
OK, look.

347
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,721
What?

348
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,031
It's nothing, but...

349
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:57,801
You may have noticed a bit
of an atmosphere because...

350
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,041
me and Jonas, years ago,
had a bit of a thing.

351
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,201
You had a thing with oily dude man?

352
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:06,281
It was just a little thing

353
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:07,801
and I didn't even know
you back then, so...

354
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,458
You slept with oily dude man?

355
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:11,601
That's hilarious!

356
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:14,281
We've all got our skeletons,
how about you and Gemma?

357
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:15,881
What, I told you about Gemma.

358
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,225
Gemma was a nutcase...

359
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,263
But you never mentioned Jonas.

360
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,157
I did, I told you I hooked up
with someone in Marrakech.

361
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,354
Jonas is Mr Marrakesh?!

362
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:25,601
It was a stupid thing...

363
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,641
I thought Mr Marrakech was some
sort of super cool...

364
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:30,681
Not him.

365
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,841
It was years ago and...

366
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:35,241
Are you embarrassed by that?

367
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,218
Cos it's embarrassing.

368
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:41,011
I'm sorry, but, Christ,
are you not embarrassed?

369
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,491
It was years ago.

370
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,251
But you dated him for a month?

371
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,451
That's what I said.

372
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:49,451
Cos when you told me about
Mr Marrakech, it was a week.

373
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:51,309
No, I didn't.

374
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:53,444
Pah!

375
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,291
'What about you?'

376
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,571
I don't want to see our
first time right now.

377
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:01,651
Syou're about to talk.

378
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:04,811
'I went away and had a little thing
that did my head in for a while

379
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,931
'with this, sort of...

380
00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:11,491
'..this, sort of, headfuck
that I met in Marrakech.'

381
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:12,811
'Mr Marrakech?'

382
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,131
'Yeah.'

383
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:17,531
'I'm imagining a chillum
and a big knob.'

384
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:21,531
'No, it was like dormouse.'

385
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:24,451
'Big deal, big heart-breaker?'

386
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,891
'No, it was just a week.

387
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,211
'It was a weird week.'

388
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:30,531
So, a weird week or a month?

389
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,371
The point is, it wasn't a big deal.

390
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:34,131
Well, it was big enough
to do your head in.

391
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,365
Jonas, King Dormouse-Dick
of Marrakech did your head in!

392
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,611
That was a nice night, used to be.

393
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,108
You're getting obsessed.

394
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:47,051
I'm not.

395
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:49,531
We had all this with Dan, I don't
want you going like that again.

396
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:52,331
He had little creepy beady eyes
and he was always...

397
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,331
What? Acting like
he was interested?

398
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:56,491
And you know what, I think
he probably did fancy me

399
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:58,571
and actually he wasn't
completely hideous,

400
00:20:58,572 --> 00:21:02,509
so in another life I don't know,
but nothing happened!

401
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:06,211
And Jonas...

402
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:10,211
he's an old fling.
So what? Don't go all fucked up!

403
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:11,851
What, I'm fucked up, am I?

404
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:13,091
No, I mean, just...

405
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:17,091
No, no, no, that's brilliant,
sometimes you're a bitch.

406
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:22,177
I didn't mean that.

407
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:24,931
'You're a bitch!'

408
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:27,091
I'd like you to erase that.

409
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:28,171
'You're a bitch!'

410
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:30,051
Also, "sometimes".

411
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:33,226
You can't just edit off
the word, "sometimes"!

412
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:18,835
I'm sorry, Fi, I know I go a bit
weird and wonky sometimes.

413
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,651
- I love you, you know?
- I know.

414
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:50,971
'..In a toolshed that just fit
together really fucking well,

415
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:54,291

"Go, on, you go to bed, honey,

'"I'm just going to catch a little
bit more of the news,"

427
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:51,032
- Morning.
- Gina, over here.

428
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:55,114
Come here a second.
I just want your opinion.

429
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:56,735
It's just a silly game.

430
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:02,914
Sit down.

431
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,644
Answer this.

432
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:08,114
I'm a serial monogamist.

433
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:11,674
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

434
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:17,497
Now, is that funny?

435
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:21,725
There's no need to be nice,
the man's a prick.

436
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:26,394
Is that funny, in your opinion?

437
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:28,190
Well...

438
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,922
I'm a serial monogamist.

439
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:33,274
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

440
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:36,582
- No?
- No

441
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:38,394
- I don't know.
- You do.

442
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,426
Morning.

443
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:41,838
What's this?

444
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,244
I'm just getting Gina's
opinion on something.

445
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:45,941
I'm a serial monogamist.

446
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:49,034
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

447
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:54,033
I was just wondering because you
found it funny, but it isn't,

448
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:55,475
and Gina agrees.

449
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,055
I don't really want to get involved.

450
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,194
Let me get you a cab.
My dad's on his way.

451
00:25:59,195 --> 00:26:00,674
Just one other thing.

452
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,522
We both want him to come back,
but who wants him to come back more?

453
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:09,792
Off the top of your head,
who wants him to come back more?

454
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,473
OK, well, bye.

455
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:12,644
Yeah, bye.

456
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:16,001
It's early. It's early
to call it a night.

457
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:18,081
Fancy a quick one down the pub?

458
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:21,197
Got to get back, rescue Jodie
from the paedophile baby-sitter.

459
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:22,394
That's just a...

460
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:24,479
That's a joke.

461
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:25,847
Sorry.

462
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:29,788
Jonas, why don't you come back to
ours for a nightcap, if you want?

463
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,041
Yeah.

464
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,018
Now, ignore the joke. Who's
more keen for him to come back?

465
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,471
I don't know.

466
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,729
You do know, Gina.

467
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:41,884
I'm so sorry, he's really hungover.

468
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:43,278
That's OK.

469
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:59,420
I'm staying faithful to
my corn flakes right now.

470
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:03,353
That is just objectively not funny.

471
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:05,352
Anyone would say,
"That's not funny."

472
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:07,104
That was fucking embarrassing.

473
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:12,794
Whatever you're queuing up, stop it.

474
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:14,303
Sit down, please.

475
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,314
You see that?

476
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,867
You know Geoff?

477
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:30,834
Yeah, you remember me and Geoff,
because he would have shown you

478
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:34,834
a re-do of the side of his fridge,
something like that.

479
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:37,553
- Spot the difference.
- You're drunk.

480
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:40,634
I'm the difference.
He's the greatest guy in the world

481
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,994
and then I arrived and... you clam.

482
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,050
For clarity.

483
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,114
We're just talking!

484
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:52,592
But moments later, you're so stiff.

485
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:54,242
I don't know, a re-do...

486
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,383
You don't know how
to stand around him.

487
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:58,834
Your gauges are all over the place,
hot and cold.

488
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:00,274
This is just stupid!

489
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:02,359
You can't hide it.
Not completely.

490
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,964
See how you look at him.

491
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:09,234
The less the relationship means,
the more you spend on the wedding.

492
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:12,514
Really, you start obsessing
about these tiny little details

493
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:15,314
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper.

494
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:18,034
Now, how you look at me.

495
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:20,554
I think it's an interesting choice,
going grainless.

496
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:21,914
It's a brave choice.

497
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:25,434
I'm sorry, but...

498
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:28,514
Tell me you look at me nice
like you look at him. You can't.

499
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:31,114
And how am I looking
at you now, Liam?

500
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:33,114
How long did you go out
with him for?

501
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,131
Does it matter?

502
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:43,754
You know, half the organic
memories you have are junk.

503
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,546
Just not trustworthy.
When it comes to little things.

504
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:47,914
And big ones.

505
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,196
Is that Marrakesh?

506
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:54,337
Does that look like Marrakesh?

507
00:28:57,675 --> 00:28:58,754
No.

508
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,754
It's not Marrakesh.

509
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:04,754
So, how long did you
go out with him for?

510
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,552
All right, about six months.

511
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:15,830
So not a week or a month.
Six months.

512
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:18,326
The ever-inflating romance.

513
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:20,274
You're probably still
going out with him.

514
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:21,872
Why am I on trial here?

515
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,954
What's been going on?

516
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:26,034
Nothing has been going on.

517
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:30,469
It was... Christ, you know how it
is when you first get with someone

518
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,790
and then previous
boyfriends come up.

519
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:36,083
He was never a boyfriend,
he was always a weird week.

520
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:38,558
I downplayed it.
I fudged it, it was...

521
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:39,433
You lied.

522
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,392
Not everything that
isn't true is a lie, Liam.

523
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:45,994
Hello?

524
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:49,178
So he was a bigger thing than I made
out and, yeah, he's sort of a dick.

525
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:50,620
Sort of? He's a massive...

526
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,434
I liked him then.

527
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:56,107
And I don't like him,
not like that, not now.

528
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:59,652
So, just to get this clear.

529
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:02,574
He fucks you, gets footage
for his redo wank file,

530
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:03,530
but you're still pally.

531
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:04,512
This is sad!

532
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:06,530
- Cos if he was...
- This is just sad!

533
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:08,372
He probably sits there
and tosses himself

534
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,907
off all over his
cashmere blanket.

535
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:11,176
It was years ago!

536
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:13,551
Not for him.

537
00:30:14,758 --> 00:30:18,212
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

538
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:20,040
early in relationships.

539
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:21,314
'Easy.'

540
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:24,513
Sober up.
Make yourself puke.

541
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:27,192
Whatever, I don't care.
Just sort this out.

542
00:30:28,182 --> 00:30:29,258
Fuck.

543
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:34,367
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

544
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,531
early in relationships.

545
00:30:36,553 --> 00:30:37,859
Easy.

546
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:44,194
And I'm downstairs watching
some redo of some night

547
00:30:44,195 --> 00:30:47,354
I've picked up somebody else and...

548
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:50,834
Yeah, nice, Geoff. She's upstairs
waiting to have sex with me

549
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,514
and I'm downstairs watching
some redo

550
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,674
of some night I've picked
up somebody else.

551
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:57,274
Easy.

552
00:30:57,275 --> 00:31:00,192
And I'm fucking pulling myself off.
I'm just saying.

553
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,022
'Green warning.

554
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:07,783

558
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,180
Thank you.

559
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:35,589
- 'Who's that?'
- It's Liam.

560
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:38,945
Liam from last night.

561
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:42,752
'Liam. Is Fi with you?'

562
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:44,473
She's not, no.

563
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:48,005
'Sorry, Liam, mate,
is there something that you want?'

564
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:50,429
Yeah, I just want to
come in and talk to you.

565
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,635
Can you open the gate?

566
00:31:51,636 --> 00:31:55,129
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll let you in.

567
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:56,932
Nice one, nice one.

568
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,851
- Hey.
- Hey.

569
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,274
What do you want?

570
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:17,608
I just want to come in
for a bit, dude.

571
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:21,792
That looks expensive.
Is that expensive?

572
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,674
Look, Liam, it's morning, mate.

573
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,952
Fucking hell. Liam.

574
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:36,061
Jonas, this is a nice place!

575
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:43,737
Hey. Seriously, man, it's not cool
you just walking in like this.

576
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:46,190
To be honest with you,
it's a little bit weird.

577
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,011
Is that a Marrakeshian lamp?

578
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,112
Liam, do I have to call Fi?

579
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:59,237
Did you guys have a row
or something like that?

580
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,139
- Sit down.
- No, I'm all right.

581
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:04,474
Go on, sit down. It's not
a bear trap, it's a chair.

582
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,352
Do you want me to bounce this
off your fucking head?

583
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:19,640
I'm joking, Jonas.

584
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,434
Bloody hell, I thought you were
supposed to be cool, man.

585
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:25,193
I thought you were meant
to be fucking brilliant.

586
00:33:25,318 --> 00:33:27,028
What's going on?

587
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:32,352
Yeah, figures.

588
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:35,432
Get some good stuff
for the scrapbook?

589
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:38,209
I think you should go.

590
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,354
I don't blame you.
I would have.

591
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,043
Tell you what, let's have a look.

592
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:45,954
Go on, chuck it
on the screen, don't be shy!

593
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,556
Come on!

594
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:50,927
I'm fucking joking again, Jonas!

595
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:54,708
For goodness' sake,
you need to grow a sense of humour.

596
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:56,972
- He's uptight, isn't he?
- OK, Liam.

597
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:02,076
- It's a lovely room, this.
- Thank you.

598
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:06,105
Is this where you masturbate
to images of my wife?

599
00:34:07,198 --> 00:34:11,041
- Or do you do it in that room?
- OK, Liam, I want you to leave now.

600
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,874
Do you sometimes start in here
and then finish in there?

601
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,181
The world's pretty much your oyster,
isn't it?

602
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:17,611
I want you to leave.

603
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,494
Well, that's a pity.

604
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:27,191
- Come on, mate.
- All right, now, what are you doing?

605
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:29,510
Don't do that.
Come on now!

606
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,008
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

607
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:35,750
- Jesus! Get out!
- Stand up, Jonas, come on!

608
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,727
Hey.

609
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,892
What do you want?

610
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,975
Don't do that.

611
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:41,434
Come on, Danny!

612
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,224
- 'What are you doing?
- 'What are you doing?

613
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:46,461
'Jesus! Get out, you fucking prick.

614
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:47,853
'Tell you what... '

615
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,245
Stop it!

616
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:57,539
I tell you what you're going to do.

617
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,219
You're going to get every bit
of Fion you've got in there

618
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,259
and you're going to select it
all and you're going to wipe it!

619
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,985
Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at five...

620
00:36:06,818 --> 00:36:07,962
'Wipe it!

621
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:09,175
'Fuck off.

622
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:11,299
'I don't have a brain chip
to show you.'

623
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,459
This is a bottle, right?

624
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,681
Either you wipe it or
I will fucking gouge you myself.

625
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,726
Jesus!

626
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:18,783
OK.

627
00:36:19,236 --> 00:36:20,877
Just do what he says.

628
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,235
Not on your eye, in there.

629
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,779
On there!

630
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,039
He's doing it!

631
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:32,126
Now, delete it all.
The lot!

632
00:36:33,044 --> 00:36:37,185
Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

633
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,624
I'm doing it.

634
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,461
Stay away from my house!

635
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,419
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

636
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:08,173
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

637
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:09,578
'I'm doing it.'

638
00:37:56,314 --> 00:37:57,620
Liam?

639
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:00,331
Where did you go?

640
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:06,696
What happened?

641
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,099
Liam, what happened?

642
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,869
Did you use a condom or not?

643
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,636
Just say.

644
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,859
Liam, whatever you think...

645
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,192
Am I Jodie's father?

646
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,819
- Liam!
- Am I?

647
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,899
Yes, of course.

648
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:27,779
- You sure about that?
- Yes!

649
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:29,847
That's nice.

650
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,465
I always liked that picture,
didn't you?

651
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,803
It's why I bought it for you.

652
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:42,459
I never liked it.
Thought it was pretentious shit.

653
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,760
'I'll tell you what you're
going to do.

654
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,779
'You're going to get every
bit of Fion... '

655
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,139
' Christ, what have you done?

656
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,219
'Select it all... '

657
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,699
We're getting to the good bit.

658
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,762
'Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at... '

659
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,899
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

660
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,529
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.'

661
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:31,798
18 months ago in this room.

662
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:45,235
You know when you suspect something,

663
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:48,437
it's always better
when it turns out to be true.

664
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,899
It's like I've had a bad tooth
for years and I'm just finally

665
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,517
getting my tongue in there and I'm
digging out all the rotten shit.

666
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,299
That's not what it looks like.

667
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,099
This did Jonas come round
to read you a story?

668
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,139
No, it was...

669
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,299
A story about fucking?

670
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,899
It was...

671
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,975
When all the Dan stuff was going on
and you'd walked out.

672
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,179
For like ten minutes.

673
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,015
For five days, Liam.

674
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,552
No call, no nothing.

675
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:23,499
So you fucked him after four days?

676
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,979
That's heroic.

677
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,819
I mean, three days,
that's admirable, but four days?

678
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,619
I mean, you must have been gagging.

679
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,141
I was so upset.

680
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:37,087
We went for a drink, I got drunk.

681
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,325
It shouldn't have happened.

682
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:42,037
I'm sorry.

683
00:40:44,184 --> 00:40:47,499
I'm so sorry,
I can't say anything else.

684
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,772
I love you.

685
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,019
Did you use a condom?

686
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,179
Yes.

687
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,944
Cos we didn't have any here.
We were trying.

688
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,579
He had some.

689
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,339
In his pocket?

690
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,722
In his car.

691
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,957
Was it his decision,
or did you make him wear one?

692
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:09,383
I made him.

693
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,426
- And you saw him put it on?
- Yes.

694
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:14,192
Show me, then.

695
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:17,460
Show me on there.

696
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,333
I need to see it, Fi.

697
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:28,815
I deleted it.

698
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,419
I wanted it to go away,
I wiped the whole thing.

699
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:33,995
- Did you?
- Yeah.

700
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,264
So there's just a blank
gap in your timeline?

701
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:37,837
Yeah.

702
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:40,218
Show me that, then.

703
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,039
Yeah, OK.

704
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:48,401
I have to find it.

705
00:41:54,885 --> 00:41:56,875
No! No deleting it, not now.

706
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,939
No, no.

707
00:42:02,024 --> 00:42:03,417
It's still on there, is it?

708
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,597
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:11,619
You have to show it to me, Fi.

710
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,819
Why?

711
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,215
Cos I want to see it.

712
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,450
I love you.

713
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,547
Show it to me.

714
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:23,059
No.

715
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,299
- Show it to me.
- No.

716
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,539
- Show it to me!
- No!

717
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,104
Show it to me! I want to see!
I want to see what he looks like!

718
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,955
This isn't me!
Look what you're doing to me!

719
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,645
Fi, I need to see it!

720
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:38,958
Please.

721
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,179
I need to see it, Fi.

722
00:43:26,794 --> 00:43:28,074
'Hurry up.

723
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:29,355
'Sorry!'

724
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:29,666
I love you.

725
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,017
I know you do.

726
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,805
Hello, stinky!

727
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,443
Hey.

728
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,234
Brown or green?

729
00:46:57,931 --> 00:46:59,260
Green?

730
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:22,459
