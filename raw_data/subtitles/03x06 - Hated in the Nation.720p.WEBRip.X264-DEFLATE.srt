Husband. Found slashed across the stomach.

- Don't know.

Restraining bolt's in place.

102
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:08,412
- No other points of entry?
- No. But the outside's ringed with CCTV.

103
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,012
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.

104
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:26,452
Okay, then. Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.

105
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:30,332
Full autop for her, and we question
the husband as soon as he wakes up.

- I'm keeping options open.

108
00:10:56,932 --> 00:11:00,372
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.

109
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,892

- Don't know anything yet.

- Oh. Okay.

116
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:46,012

- Digital Forensics. Computer murk.

117
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:49,332
What happened,
you get bored of it?

118
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:54,652
Not exactly. You've seen
what people tuck away on these.

119
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:59,012
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.

120
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:01,732
I'm old enough to remember
when they walked around with that stuff

121
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:04,052
just tucked away in their heads.

122
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:08,212
Right. But now they can't help but
entrusting it to their little companions.

123
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:12,652
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.

124
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:16,772
If it's interesting,
why leave Forensics?

125
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:20,852
The Rannoch case.

126
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:26,492
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.

127
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:30,812
I was the one
who cracked his souvenir folder.

128
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:38,372
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:42,292
And the videos too. Saw them all.

130

You see something like that,
it changes you.

131

You either get defeated or you think...

132
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:55,692
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."

Yeah.

134
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:03,852

- What fucking field?

135
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:08,972
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world,

_

161
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,292
Um... So...

162
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:38,412
I'm collating every threat
or insult levelled at Jo Powers

163
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,572
over the previous 48 hours.

164
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,372
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?

165
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:49,332
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.

166
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:52,132
Stress levels in that household
would've been through the roof.

167
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:55,292
That Internet stuff
drifts off like weather.

168
00:15:55,372 --> 00:16:00,412
It's half hate. They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.

169
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,812
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.

170
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:09,692
- Yeah. I'm divorced.
- Um...

171
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:13,852
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.

172
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:16,523
_

173
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:42,372
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

174
00:16:43,972 --> 00:16:49,092
And when I ran in, she was walking
'round the room, stumbling.

175
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:52,892
She was clutching... She was clutching
her head as if she was in pain.

176
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:57,012
And then for a moment, she stopped.

177
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,612
And then it was like a seizure, she was...

178
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:06,732
thrashing... clawing at her own skin.

179
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:14,252
And she turned...

180
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:24,452
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.

181
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,212
Then she... she pushed me over.

182
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,852
That must've been when the bottle smashed.

183
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:34,092
Then she picked it up,
and she started cutting herself.

184
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,692
Here. She was gouging.

185
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,892
I tried to stop her.

186
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:46,612
But she did this.

187
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:50,572
Then she cut her throat.

188
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:53,372
I tried to stop her.

189
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:56,892
She cut her own throat with the glass!

190
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:10,972
Mutilated and then killed herself
for no apparent reason?

191
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,012
I'd say the odds are against that.

192
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,972
He said it was like
she was having a seizure.

193
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,612
Maybe there was something in the cake.

194
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:18,732
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.

195
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,772
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?

196
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:23,452
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?

197
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:25,212
He was sort of convincing.

198
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:29,212
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."

199
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,132
He's ordinary. That <i>is </i>the type.

200
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,132
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

201
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,652
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...

202
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,132
- Blue.
- What?

203
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:39,652
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.

204
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,332
Meantime, let's drop in
on the person that sent it.

205
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,332
Got the name this morning.

206
00:18:56,492 --> 00:19:00,412
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.

207
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:03,172
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.

208
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:07,612
Picking along dead ends just
to prove they're dead ends,

209
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,252
that's most of the job.

210
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,692
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just...

211
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,892
you haven't had a chance
to get bored of reality yet.

212
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,892
Okay, that <i>was</i> patronizing.

213
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,612
- Is this who sent the cake?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:34,052
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.

215
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,798
_

216
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:05,452
"Death to Jo Powers."
She posted that on Monday morning.

217
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:15,212
The bakery said that they're
not meant to do obscenities,

218
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:19,172
so I said it was for my sister,
like just a joke thing,

219
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,452
and they agreed, so...

220
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:27,012
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

221
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,492
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

222
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:33,132
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?

223
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:35,612
Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers
message board.

224
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,132
I held a sort of whip-round.

225
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,852
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.

226
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:42,412
From 80 other people?

227
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:45,972
Look, I'm not...

228
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:49,772
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.

229
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,652
But did you read what she had written?

230
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:57,092
How much do you think she got paid
for spouting that horrible shit?

231
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,692
I don't know.

232
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:04,492
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.

233
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:08,492
It was funny, okay?

234
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:12,412
And I can see if I'd done it myself,
then that would be a bit weird,

235
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:14,212
but I'm not mental.

236
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:20,172
You wished she was dead.

237
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:22,652
Well, uh...

238
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,612
No, no, I didn't.

239
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:31,332
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- That's just...

240
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:35,212
It's a... a hashtag game, you know,
like "Death to..."

241
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,572
You insert the name
of someone who's being an arsehole.

242
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:41,492
It's not... real. It's a joke thing.

243
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:43,932
And who started it? The hashtag?

244
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,972
I don't know. I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.

245
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,012
Excuse us a moment.

246
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:00,572
Toxicology say the cake's clean.

247
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:04,572
"Thanks, it was delicious."

248
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:11,092
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.

249
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:14,972
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.

250
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:27,292
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?

251
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:33,012
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.

252
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:46,692
Hospital's discharging the husband
tomorrow.

253
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,332
We'll bring him in for questioning.

254
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:56,452
Blue? We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.

255
00:22:56,532 --> 00:22:59,012
The Internet will be pissed off
with someone else today.

256
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:00,452
Tusk.

257
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:04,852
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk
'cause of that thing with the kid.

258
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,172
He's catching a shit storm
on social media.

259
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:14,852
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.

260
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:17,732
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

261
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:23,928
_

262
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,852
- Whoo!
- <i>♪ Turn a penny to a grand ♪</i>

263
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:39,772
<i>♪ When I'm ready,
rocking steady for my fans ♪</i>

264
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,252
Where my ladies at?

265
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:45,532
- Yo! Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.

266
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,932
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?

267
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:50,012
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.

268
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:51,772
A'ight.

269
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:54,332
Damn!

270
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:57,092
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

271
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:00,332
Don't stress. It's legal here.

272
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:04,292
Pfft! Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.

273
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:07,652
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.

274
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:11,372
Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

275
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:14,892
Always doing some bullshit.

276
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,212
Tusk? Tusk?

277
00:24:19,412 --> 00:24:21,572
Yo, yo! We need some help over here!

278
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:30,292
- I got you.
- Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

279
00:24:30,372 --> 00:24:31,732
Call an ambulance!

280
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:24,852
Commencing.

281
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:10,012
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.

282
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:23,252
- Good morning.
- Morning.

283
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:33,692
She's in here.

284
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:37,252
So I go in,

285
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:39,292
and there's not just the wound
from the glass.

286
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:43,652
There's a hole. Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

287
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:46,452
So I follow it, you know,
how deep does it go?

288
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,732
It goes all the way from her ear canal
to deep in her brain.

289
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:54,572
Where I find this.

290
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:57,412
Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

291
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:01,412
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.

292
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:05,372
An Autonomous Drone Insect
from the Granular Project.

293
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,812
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.

294
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:13,692
- Fuck me.
- That's not the worst part.

295
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:16,372
It crawled right through
her dorsal posterior insula,

296
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:19,332
which is basically
the brain's pain centre.

297
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,252
You're talking agony off the scale.

298
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:27,732
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.

299
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:46,692
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.

300
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,292
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay. Thank you.

301
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:19,892
They're so fucking fancy-looking,
these companies.

302
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:22,652
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.

303
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:25,452
The whole ADI project's pretty much
bankrolled by the government.

304
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:27,532
It's why so many people
are paranoid about it.

305
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:31,132
Let me guess,
this is some people on the Internet?

306
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,292
They reckon the government
uses the bees to spy on us.

307
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:37,612
There's a schizophrenic world view.

308
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:55,772
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself
living in the future,

309
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:57,172
but here I fucking well am.

310
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:02,252
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.

311
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:03,532
Vanessa Dahl.

312
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:07,532
Please. Follow me.

313
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:20,572
You're after information
on our Project Swarm ADIs?

314
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:22,292
That's right.

315
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:24,892
Any particular reason?

316
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,772
Yes.

317
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,332
Rasmus.

318
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:52,972
Rasmus Sjoberg.

319
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,972
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.

320
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:57,132
- Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:30:57,212 --> 00:31:00,572
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.

322
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:07,092
So, your bees, your ADIs,
talk me through them.

323
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:10,892
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.

324
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:13,892
Bees themselves were virtually extinct

325
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:18,092
so what our ADIs do
is effectively stand in for them.

326
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:21,292
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.

327
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:23,172
but they pollinate flowers the same way.

328
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:26,292
They crawl inside,
pollen sticks to their legs

329
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:28,412
and gets brushed off
the next flower they visit.

330
00:31:28,492 --> 00:31:30,972
- Can they make honey?
- Uh... No.

331
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:32,772
I was joking.

332
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:38,892
How do they know
where the flowers even are? I mean...

333
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:40,252
Well, they have a sensor.

334
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,412
Like a... camera?

335
00:31:43,492 --> 00:31:46,252
No. Just a basic visual sensor.

336
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:48,852
You see,
they need rudimentary pattern recognition

337
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:51,772
in order to locate compatible flora
and navigate.

338
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:53,852
- <i>They</i> navigate?
- Yes.

339
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:57,572
You don't... I don't know... steer them?

340
00:31:57,652 --> 00:32:00,212
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?

341
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,052
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.

342
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:05,212
Yes. You see, the ADIs
cover the whole of the UK.

343
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,892
We couldn't command each one
individually ourselves.

344
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:09,572
It's just not logistically possible.

345
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:13,612
No. We simply
set the behaviour and leave them to it.

346
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:16,612
They even construct these hives
themselves.

347
00:32:16,692 --> 00:32:17,852
They reproduce...

348
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:22,572
- They reproduce?
- Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

349
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:24,932
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.

350
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,172
They create duplicates of themselves,

351
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:30,212
create more hives
and spread out exponentially.

352
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,852
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.

353
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,732
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.

354
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:40,452
It is. It's just a shame it's necessary.

355
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:43,132
The alternative would have been
environmental catastrophe.

356
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:44,892
Bees were dying out.

357
00:32:46,652 --> 00:32:49,292
So, what is it that brings you here?

358
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:55,692
We think one of your ADIs
may be involved in an unexplained death.

359
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:57,732
Sorry? A death?

360
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,092
Uh-huh.

361
00:33:12,412 --> 00:33:13,652
Thank you.

362
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:33,732
Yeah. It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...

363
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:38,132
Kill people? I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?

364
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:43,012
No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

365
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:46,452
It happens, but then they just break,
they just hit the ground.

366
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:50,332
What if someone hacked one and then
they found a way of controlling it?

367
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:51,692
That's impossible.

368
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:54,292
You see,
it's got military-grade encryption,

369
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:57,892
and you would need a diagnostic
controller, which is also encrypted.

370
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:59,692
So I would say the likelihood is...

371
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:03,092
I don't know what he's saying,
but it's not the same as "impossible."

372
00:34:10,772 --> 00:34:13,532
This is every hive we have online.

373
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:16,852
See...

374
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:21,892
These are the hives in the building here.

375
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,652
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.

376
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,052
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.

377
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,932
Is that the search input?

378
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:34,052
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.

379
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:40,532
Jo Powers' postcode.

380
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,292
Is that who this is about?

381
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:45,212
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.

382
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,332
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.

383
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:51,532
You know, put them in the microwave
for YouTube videos.

384
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:53,332
And this logs
any that drop off the system?

385
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:54,452
Logs everything, yes.

386
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,612
Did you lose any around here
on Monday evening?

387
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:58,012
Well, I can check.

388
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:06,332
Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.

389
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:09,172
There.

390
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:14,212
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

391
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,292
When they pass between hives,

392
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:18,812
they switch from one jurisdiction
to another.

393
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:22,932
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?

394
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:27,572
Exactly. It tried to do that,
but there was nothing to switch to.

395
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:32,412
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then
they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

396
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:35,572
No, you would need
a diagnostic controller to do that.

397
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:37,092
What's the range on one of those?

398
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:40,172
Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.

399
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:44,332
So whoever was controlling it would have
to be no more than 20 metres away.

400
00:35:44,412 --> 00:35:47,612
- Outside the house.
- Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

401
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:51,372
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

402
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:52,452
Uh...

403
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:58,812
You know what? Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.

404
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:04,172
Okay.

405
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:07,372
You two swap numbers,
keep a line of communication.

406
00:36:07,452 --> 00:36:11,692
Can you shut the whole thing down
if need be... hypothetically speaking?

407
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:13,772
Even a short stoppage
would damage the ecosystem,

408
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,692
and we'd need approval
from the Department of the Environment.

409
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:21,412
We'll need a list of any Granular staff
that had access to that system,

410
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:22,572
past or present.

411
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:24,572
Some were government employees.

412
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,212
Use a different font for those
if it helps.

413
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:31,252
Bye.

414
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:02,252
Nick, that's a set
of Granular personnel records.

415
00:37:02,332 --> 00:37:03,732
Root out anyone interesting.

416
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:05,532
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.

417
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:07,332
Technically we should refer this up
to the NCA,

418
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:09,772
but there's no fucking way
they're taking this off me.

419
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,212
The NCA already knows about it.

420
00:37:12,852 --> 00:37:13,892
What?

421
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:17,252
DCI Karin Parke?

422
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:22,132
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

423
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:24,452
How come you're here?

424
00:37:25,572 --> 00:37:27,052
There's been more than one.

425
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:43,732
This is Tusk, last night.

426
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:46,212
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.

427
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,372
Took him to the hospital.

428
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:50,252
He had to be anaesthetised
to stop him mutilating himself.

429
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:54,772
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind
of plaque or tumour in his brain

430
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:57,532
so they popped him in the MRI.

431
00:37:57,612 --> 00:38:01,332
Yeah. Basically one big magnet.

432
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,572
Tore it right out of his head,
through the eye socket.

433
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,692
Battered the ADI too.

434
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:12,972
Yours is more intact
so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

435
00:38:13,052 --> 00:38:14,572
It's evidence.

436
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:18,052
Two's a pattern. It knocks
any malfunction theory in the head.

437
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:21,132
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?

438
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:23,532
Both in the middle of online shit storms.

439
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:26,972
Well, if you wanna kill someone,
there's a million easier ways to do it.

440
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:30,132
Pull this off and you've done it
from across the street.

441
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:34,692
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.

442
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:45,492
Fuck.

443
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:55,172
Fuck.

444
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:02,332
Guys? Come here.

445
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:16,652
Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk,

446
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,052
both were being kicked around
the Internet for hours,

447
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:22,692
but in both their cases,
people were also tweeting their photos

448
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:25,372
#DeathTo.

449
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:27,892
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.

450
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:31,732
She didn't know where she'd first heard
of it, but trace it back,

451
00:39:31,812 --> 00:39:35,492
and it looks like the first real use
of the hashtag was last weekend.

452
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:37,612
- By who?
- Uh...

453
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,412
Looks like, um...

454
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:43,572
Looks like identical tweets
from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

455
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:46,572
Um...

456
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:50,052
Automated. It's like spam.

457
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:53,732
This is someone trying to seed the tag,
you know? Get it out there.

458
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:57,652
It's like bait. This is someone
wanting people to pick up on it.

459
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:00,652
Check out the senders' avatar photos.

460
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:04,372
Bees. Shit.

461
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,052
Okay.

462
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,292
There's more.

463
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:13,052
So each tweet had a sort of
instruction video attached to it.

464
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,452
- Uh-huh.
- There.

465
00:40:14,532 --> 00:40:16,812
"Game of Consequences"?

466
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,092
It's like an unpopularity contest.

467
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:22,492
Pick someone you don't like and if enough
other people choose the same name,

468
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:24,532
then that's who gets targeted.

469
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:27,892
Here, watch.

470
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:30,052
<i>Game of Consequences.</i>

471
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:34,732
<i>- Pick a target.</i>
- Oh, my God.

472
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:39,012
<i>Post their name and photo
with #DeathTo.</i>

473
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:40,092
No.

474
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:45,932
<i>Most popular target
will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.</i>

475
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:48,972
<i>Game resets at midnight.</i>

476
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:50,892
- Oh, no.
- Fuck.

477
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:56,892
Someone's holding a public ballot,
bumping off the top person.

478
00:40:57,812 --> 00:41:02,572
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.

479
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:09,532
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag
on Jo Powers, okay?

480
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:13,932
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

481
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:18,932
- Who's using it now?
- There's... There's loads more people.

482
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:20,972
There's quite a few votes
for the Chancellor.

483
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:22,812
- Yeah.
- Um...

484
00:41:22,892 --> 00:41:24,652
But at number one...

485
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:30,172
is 880 people using it
on someone called Clara Meades.

486
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:33,332
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.

487
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:36,292
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo,

488
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:39,052
and she took a selfie
in front of a war memorial.

489
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:43,372
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.

490
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:44,852
Yeah, it's getting near the end
of the vote,

491
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:46,692
and her mentions are blowing up.

492
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:49,812
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.

493
00:41:49,892 --> 00:41:53,852
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.

494
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:57,532
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.

495
00:41:57,612 --> 00:41:59,652
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

496
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:03,052
You're not supposed
to have access to that.

497
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:05,812
Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

498
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:08,892
There.

499
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,019
_

500
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:32,602
_

501
00:42:32,685 --> 00:42:34,207
_

502
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:35,448
_

503
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:41,692
_

504
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:42,872
_

505
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,412
_

506
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:45,772
Hello?

507
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:53,172
Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.

508
00:42:53,252 --> 00:42:54,052
Clara!

509
00:42:56,972 --> 00:43:01,892
Police. For you.
How did they get my number?

510
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:05,652
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?

511
00:43:05,732 --> 00:43:07,252
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

512
00:43:07,332 --> 00:43:09,692
Sorry to track you down like this,
but we think you may be in danger.

513
00:43:09,772 --> 00:43:13,532
Sorry, is this a joke? Because
all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.

514
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:16,292
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.

515
00:43:16,372 --> 00:43:18,092
And keep your windows closed.

516
00:43:19,372 --> 00:43:21,412
I'm setting up a perimeter.

517
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:23,332
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

518
00:43:31,252 --> 00:43:32,492
- Rasmus?
- <i>Hi, Blue.</i>

519
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:34,652
<i>I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.</i>

520
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:36,412
I need you to monitor the area.

521
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:40,612
Track my location and see if you get
anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?

522
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:41,772
<i>Yeah, great, good.</i>

523
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,772
Look, if they come back,

524
00:43:43,852 --> 00:43:45,572
I think I can catch them.

525
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:47,612
<i>I have basically set a trap.</i>

526
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,532
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.

527
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:07,252
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.

528
00:44:07,332 --> 00:44:10,652
This'll turn every red light
between here and there to green.

529
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,612
Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,
I should apply for a transfer.

530
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,172
Let's go.

531
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:25,732
_

532
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:27,212
We can take her here.

533
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,372
It's a safe house
for terrorist informers usually.

534
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,932
<i>No target sighted.</i>

535
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:53,092
<i>This is a police operation!</i>

536
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:57,492
<i>Everybody vacate their premises now.</i>

537
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,692
<i>Please leave...</i>

538
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:07,932
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.

539
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:29,332
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.

540
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:30,732
Granular, they've got a breach.

541
00:45:33,812 --> 00:45:37,132
- <i>One ADI just went offline.</i>
- Where?

542
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:41,012
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.

543
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:42,772
If someone's trying to pilot it this way,

544
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:44,772
they're gonna turn 'round
the moment they see all these uniforms.

545
00:45:52,892 --> 00:45:56,332
Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?

546
00:45:56,412 --> 00:45:59,452
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.

547
00:46:41,692 --> 00:46:44,212
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.

548
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:47,052
_

549
00:47:02,372 --> 00:47:05,852
It's just precautionary,
and it's only for one night.

550
00:47:33,612 --> 00:47:35,372
Just gotta call in.

551
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:42,012
Hi.

552
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:45,492
No, not yet.

553
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:50,412
Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

554
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:54,132
Understood.

555
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:10,252
They housed a witness here for a while,
Shaun said.

556
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:13,972
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?

557
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:15,132
No.

558
00:48:16,332 --> 00:48:17,812
No plans.

559
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,092
Up the stairs.

560
00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:48,652
- Rasmus.
- <i>Still nothing. I can't trace it.</i>

561
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:07,932
At least there's an en-suite.

562
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:13,652
- Is there nothing?
<i>- No.</i>

563
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:16,412
<i>Whoever it is,
they've masked their path well.</i>

564
00:49:18,412 --> 00:49:19,772
But that's not...

565
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:24,692
- Fuck.
<i>- What?</i>

566
00:49:24,772 --> 00:49:27,772
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?

567
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:29,212
<i>Packed full of ADIs.</i>

568
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,572
Lost them all too.

569
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:33,492
- No... Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.

570
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:36,572
- Where?
- It's close to your location.

571
00:49:36,652 --> 00:49:38,052
Rasmus, say that again.

572
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:41,492
Blue? Blue. It's close...
It's very close to you.

573
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:46,812
- Text it. Text it to me.
- Rasmus. Text it to... Shit.

574
00:49:47,572 --> 00:49:49,012
Do I get to redecorate?

575
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:02,052
Hello. Hello.

576
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:13,652
No...

577
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,852
They've got the whole thing.

578
00:50:18,132 --> 00:50:19,972
We're not in control anymore.

579
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:22,652
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?

580
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,452
- Fix it! Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!

581
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:00,132
_

582
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:07,212
Shit.

583
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,572
We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!

584
00:51:18,572 --> 00:51:20,372
Go. Go, go, go.

585
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:29,692
What's... what's happening?

586
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:50,412
Karin...

587
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,212
In there! Go!

588
00:52:11,652 --> 00:52:14,372
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!

589
00:52:14,452 --> 00:52:15,652
You're scaring the shit out of me!

590
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:01,772
Oh! Fuck!

591
00:53:32,732 --> 00:53:35,412
The fan! The fan!

592
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,212
Get it away from me!

593
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:00,172
Take your time.

594
00:55:09,332 --> 00:55:12,172
I'd seen so many bodies before.

595
00:55:14,052 --> 00:55:16,652
At crime scenes, in autopsies.

596
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,772
But I'd never seen anyone die.

597
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:26,732
And she was right there.

598
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:34,652
And can you describe the reaction
of your colleague, Miss Colson?

599
00:55:37,092 --> 00:55:38,772
Blue took it hard.

600
00:55:45,212 --> 00:55:46,212
Uh-huh.

601
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:50,572
I'll shut it down.

602
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,292
We thought this was one guy,
some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity,

603
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:16,492
hijacking one ADI
and personally controlling it.

604
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:17,892
But there were thousands of them.

605
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:19,892
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.

606
00:56:19,972 --> 00:56:21,892
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.

607
00:56:21,972 --> 00:56:24,692
Whoever this is,
they're controlling the whole system.

608
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:26,492
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.

609
00:56:26,572 --> 00:56:29,252
You need to fucking sort this out!

610
00:56:36,612 --> 00:56:39,012
How do the ADIs know who to target?

611
00:56:40,572 --> 00:56:43,772
Could've found Clara the same way
you did, the identity database?

612
00:56:43,852 --> 00:56:45,772
No. That just gives you the basic area.

613
00:56:45,852 --> 00:56:48,572
We were in the room too,
and they only went for her.

614
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:54,372
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.

615
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,692
Which means the feed from their visual
sensors, that's been accessed too.

616
00:56:57,772 --> 00:56:59,492
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.

617
00:56:59,572 --> 00:57:03,572
Now look, the visual feed is secure
between each ADI and the hive.

618
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:05,452
- There you go.
- Although...

619
00:57:05,532 --> 00:57:08,052
one of the government's conditions
for backing the project...

620
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:09,172
Okay. Enough.

621
00:57:09,252 --> 00:57:13,812
We had to consent to permitting
government security services

622
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:18,972
access to the visual feed at times
of quote, "increased national security."

623
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:22,732
Which is, as I understand it,
pretty much all the time.

624
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:24,972
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.

625
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:28,972
That implies a greater range
of options than your lot presented.

626
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:32,892
- So they <i>are</i> spying on us.
- This is all classified.

627
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:37,892
So what did you do, did you put in
a back door and route it through GCHQ?

628
00:57:37,972 --> 00:57:40,932
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

629
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:42,892
So what don't you have
your fucking noses in?

630
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:46,612
Look, millions of those things
flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

631
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:49,572
Well, that's great, save the planet,
hallelujah!

632
00:57:49,652 --> 00:57:52,092
Government's not going
to pump billions into it

633
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:55,692
just 'cause some lab coat says so,
and it grabs 200 green votes.

634
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,732
They saw an opportunity to get more,
they took it.

635
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:01,452
Total nationwide surveillance.

636
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:04,012
We tracked suspects for weeks
in ways they couldn't dream of.

637
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:07,692
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.

638
00:58:07,772 --> 00:58:09,812
And keeping them safe,
which is what they want.

639
00:58:09,892 --> 00:58:11,772
Clara Meades isn't safe, though,
is she, Shaun?

640
00:58:13,212 --> 00:58:15,492
Knowing what you knew,
that might've helped us,

641
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:17,252
but no,
you kept your little fucking secret.

642
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:22,252
Okay! The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.

643
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,932
Word's going to get out about Clara.

644
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:29,572
The public's going to wake up and find
this mental assassination game going on,

645
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:31,972
and soon we're going to have another body.

646
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:35,612
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

647
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:38,772
We're totally locked out. Totally blind.

648
00:58:39,812 --> 00:58:41,412
If I can work out how they got in,

649
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:45,652
I might be able to reverse engineer
some means of getting control back.

650
00:58:45,732 --> 00:58:48,492
Do the ADIs have a command log,
on-board cache?

651
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,772
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.

652
00:59:01,932 --> 00:59:04,532
Been through the employee files,
found some POIs.

653
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:06,452
Bring them in.

654
00:59:08,452 --> 00:59:10,932
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?

655
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:12,172
I've got to be somewhere.

656
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:27,892
<i>It's 7:15.</i>

657
00:59:27,972 --> 00:59:31,572
<i>Three deaths have now been linked
to a hashtag circulating on social media.</i>

658
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,612
<i>Controversial journalist Jo Powers...</i>

659
00:59:33,692 --> 00:59:36,492
<i>Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?</i>

660
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:38,172
<i>Is it real or an urban myth?</i>

661
00:59:38,252 --> 00:59:42,252
<i>Well, thousands have been taking part,
but how culpable are they?</i>

662
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:45,452
<i>People are dying,</i>
<i>and</i> we <i>want to hear your thoughts.</i>

663
00:59:45,532 --> 00:59:47,092
<i>Line seven, Liana...</i>

664
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:49,692
<i>This is real, this is happening...</i>

665
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:51,852
<i>I am happy to see her die.</i>

666
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:55,612
<i>It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.</i>

667
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:59,012
<i>Like, if you're an arsehole,
you deserve to be shamed.</i>

668
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:00,612
<i>Steve, line five.</i>

669
01:00:00,692 --> 01:00:03,412
<i>Yeah, but my point is,
someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?</i>

670
01:00:03,492 --> 01:00:06,572
<i>So why not make it someone,
you know, who deserves it, like a racist.</i>

671
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:09,492
<i>With the hashtag, I've seen
celebrities, politicians, everyone.</i>

672
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:12,612
<i>This doesn't mean you have to sit there
encouraging people to take part.</i>

673
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,812
<i>The point is this is already happening.</i>

674
01:00:14,892 --> 01:00:16,292
<i>And people know that they can jump onboard</i>

675
01:00:16,372 --> 01:00:18,732
<i>because nobody will ever know
if they did or didn't.</i>

676
01:00:18,812 --> 01:00:21,612
<i>Well, let's just pause for a moment
and go back to that top five.</i>

677
01:00:21,692 --> 01:00:24,932
<i>As we have been saying,
the Chancellor is at number one,</i>

678
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:26,732
<i>and I want us to think about that.</i>

679
01:00:26,812 --> 01:00:28,972
<i>What does that tell us
about the choice of the nation?</i>

680
01:00:29,052 --> 01:00:32,852
<i>Well, I can't say I'm surprised
that he's number one on the list.</i>

681
01:00:32,932 --> 01:00:35,172
<i>He's been pretty unpopular
for quite a long time now.</i>

682
01:00:35,252 --> 01:00:37,572
<i>But does that warrant
his place on this list?</i>

683
01:00:37,652 --> 01:00:40,332
<i>I'm saying people
don't have to think too hard about it.</i>

684
01:00:40,452 --> 01:00:41,532
<i>Now that's he's number one,</i>

685
01:00:41,612 --> 01:00:45,172
<i>that should generate more discussions
and probably more votes.</i>

686
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:58,032
_

687
01:01:01,452 --> 01:01:02,932
Thanks for your time.

688
01:01:09,852 --> 01:01:12,732
- No good?
- No good.

689
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:41,692
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.

690
01:01:41,772 --> 01:01:44,052
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.

691
01:01:44,132 --> 01:01:47,292
Forgive me for being sceptical
about your agency's basic competence.

692
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:49,772
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

693
01:01:49,852 --> 01:01:52,452
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!

694
01:01:52,532 --> 01:01:54,492
Farrington's number four,
and he's a paedophile.

695
01:01:54,572 --> 01:01:57,812
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it. You know he did.

696
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:05,492
Let's just shut it down. All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

697
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:07,452
Just for today,

698
01:02:07,532 --> 01:02:09,132
at least until Thumbelina here
pulls his finger out

699
01:02:09,212 --> 01:02:10,532
and he actually catches someone.

700
01:02:10,612 --> 01:02:12,532
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.

701
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:15,172
- But it's possible? We can do that?
- The whole of social media?

702
01:02:15,252 --> 01:02:18,692
- Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.

703
01:02:18,772 --> 01:02:20,812
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.

704
01:02:21,532 --> 01:02:23,092
- No?
- Not in my opinion.

705
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:28,772
Right, okay. It's just that speaking
as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

706
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:31,172
If we shut it down,
you'll still be number one.

707
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:32,252
Guaranteed to be, in fact.

708
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:35,812
He's right. If we let it run on,
at least there's a few hours.

709
01:02:36,372 --> 01:02:39,172
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.

710
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:42,572
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report? The archive job?

711
01:02:43,452 --> 01:02:45,652
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

712
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:48,532
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.

713
01:02:48,652 --> 01:02:50,452
Tom, that would be a smear.

714
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:52,572
A head-to-toe shit smear,
I fucking hope so.

715
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:55,172
He's in his 80s. He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.

716
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:59,772
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.

717
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:04,092
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.

718
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:05,972
I'll show you.

719
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:21,372
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.

720
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:23,292
So not much
in the way of technical skills.

721
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:26,252
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

722
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:29,572
Worked in Human Resources
for Granular until she quit.

723
01:03:29,652 --> 01:03:32,972
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube,
said he'd harassed her,

724
01:03:33,052 --> 01:03:34,172
lewd comments or something.

725
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:37,612
Turned out he had a learning disability
so she caught a ton of shit on...

726
01:03:37,692 --> 01:03:39,172
On social media.

727
01:03:47,652 --> 01:03:50,532
- Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.

728
01:03:50,698 --> 01:03:52,885
_

729
01:03:59,692 --> 01:04:06,132
It was like having a whole weather system
turn against me.

730
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:11,612
Just hate message after hate message,
around the clock, all piling on.

731
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:16,132
It's hard to describe what that does
to your head.

732
01:04:16,692 --> 01:04:20,132
Suddenly
there's a million invisible people,

733
01:04:20,212 --> 01:04:23,492
all talking about how they despise you.

734
01:04:25,452 --> 01:04:27,772
It's like a mental illness.

735
01:04:33,532 --> 01:04:34,332
Fuck.

736
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,372
What?

737
01:04:45,652 --> 01:04:46,692
Shit.

738
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:50,852
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake,

739
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:55,412
but the way people enjoyed kicking me,
that's what got to me.

740
01:04:57,452 --> 01:05:01,892
The casual fun they had and, um...

741
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:06,292
I just felt I couldn't go on.

742
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:12,212
Who found you?

743
01:05:14,972 --> 01:05:17,972
Um... Garrett, my flatmate.

744
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:21,212
He found me in the bath
five minutes after I'd slashed them.

745
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:26,092
I mean, it's crazy.

746
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,772
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath,

747
01:05:29,852 --> 01:05:33,172
and I'm telling him to get out,
saying, "I'm naked."

748
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:39,012
He tied towels 'round my wrists,
kept me conscious,

749
01:05:39,092 --> 01:05:44,172
kept stroking my hair
till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

750
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,412
Sort of weird.

751
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:51,972
I think he always had a thing for me.

752
01:05:52,052 --> 01:05:55,972
And we worked at the same place so,
you know... awkward.

753
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:59,572
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah. On the ADI thing.

754
01:05:59,652 --> 01:06:04,372
- He was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?

755
01:06:05,372 --> 01:06:08,532
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

756
01:06:13,812 --> 01:06:16,572
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...

757
01:06:16,652 --> 01:06:18,772
Scholes. We were about to tell you.

758
01:06:18,852 --> 01:06:21,172
It was buried in the on-board memory
of the Jo Powers' ADI.

759
01:06:21,252 --> 01:06:24,972
- What was?
- A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

760
01:06:25,052 --> 01:06:27,172
_

761
01:06:27,252 --> 01:06:29,732
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.

762
01:06:43,452 --> 01:06:44,932
<i>So we're good to go?</i>

763
01:06:53,252 --> 01:06:54,772
<i>Okay, that's the charge in place.</i>

764
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:57,852
Okay. Pull back.

765
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:03,972
<i>We're all set here.</i>

766
01:07:04,052 --> 01:07:05,212
Detonate.

767
01:07:12,812 --> 01:07:16,092
So, the plan is,
we move you to an underground bunker,

768
01:07:16,852 --> 01:07:19,372
knock out every hive
within a ten-mile radius.

769
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,372
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?

770
01:07:22,052 --> 01:07:23,332
It's a temporary measure.

771
01:07:25,012 --> 01:07:27,212
How long till you take out all the hives?

772
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:30,812
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.

773
01:07:30,892 --> 01:07:32,732
Two years, a victim a day.

774
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:34,852
More to the point,
the environmental impact would...

775
01:07:34,932 --> 01:07:36,572
Fuck that.

776
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,172
<i>Shit!</i>

777
01:07:39,252 --> 01:07:40,812
- <i>What?
- Fuck!</i>

778
01:07:41,372 --> 01:07:44,212
<i>Stay back, stay back!</i>

779
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:45,612
<i>Get back!</i>

780
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:54,252
<i>Go, go, go! Get away!</i>

781
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:59,292
<i>For fuck's sake, move!</i>

782
01:08:08,932 --> 01:08:10,292
What's your Plan B?

783
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:45,972
He was on the original employee roster,
but we discounted him.

784
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:47,452
He left the country six months ago.

785
01:08:47,532 --> 01:08:49,372
We thought we were looking
for someone nearby.

786
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:51,972
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.

787
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:55,252
Lunatic with production values,
that's the worst kind.

788
01:08:56,252 --> 01:08:58,532
"Thanks to the technological revolution,

789
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:03,452
we have the power to rage and accuse,
spout bile without consequence.

790
01:09:03,532 --> 01:09:07,052
Only by being forced to recognize
the power technology grants us,

791
01:09:07,132 --> 01:09:09,372
to acknowledge
individual responsibility..."

792
01:09:10,132 --> 01:09:11,332
Is it all like this?

793
01:09:11,892 --> 01:09:15,972
He likens the population to insects,
says we revel in cruelty,

794
01:09:16,052 --> 01:09:18,572
that it's a weakness
that should be bred out of us.

795
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:22,732
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face
the consequences of what they say and do.

796
01:09:22,812 --> 01:09:26,612
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?

797
01:09:30,052 --> 01:09:32,372
He wanted us to find this
and spread it about.

798
01:09:32,452 --> 01:09:33,732
Well, fuck him.

799
01:09:44,024 --> 01:09:47,601
_

800
01:09:49,277 --> 01:09:52,311
_

801
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:55,012
Fuck.

802
01:10:06,805 --> 01:10:08,692
_

803
01:10:26,175 --> 01:10:27,724
_

804
01:10:34,852 --> 01:10:36,092
Shit.

805
01:10:37,932 --> 01:10:41,612
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

806
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:47,372
He's put this document
together himself, right?

807
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:50,772
His author name's in the metadata.

808
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:52,452
But he stripped out everything else,

809
01:10:52,532 --> 01:10:54,612
so we don't know when he's written it,
for example.

810
01:10:54,692 --> 01:10:55,572
Mm-hmm.

811
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:59,372
Most of the photos are clipart
off the Internet, except this one.

812
01:10:59,452 --> 01:11:01,892
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.

813
01:11:01,972 --> 01:11:04,852
He's taken it with his phone,
and the phone left a geotag on the image.

814
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:08,732
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.

815
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:11,932
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

816
01:11:25,195 --> 01:11:27,914
_

817
01:11:54,052 --> 01:11:56,332
- Armed police! Stay down!
- Armed police!

818
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:01,852
Armed police! Stay where you are!
Armed police! Show yourselves!

819
01:12:10,252 --> 01:12:11,452
Move!

820
01:12:12,932 --> 01:12:13,972
Left.

821
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:16,612
- Clear!
- Clear!

822
01:12:16,692 --> 01:12:18,412
Clear!

823
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:16,012
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.

824
01:13:22,852 --> 01:13:25,012
There. The forge.

825
01:13:33,452 --> 01:13:35,012
Nice one.

826
01:13:35,092 --> 01:13:38,052
Half the drives I sifted in forensics
had scorch marks on 'em.

827
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:54,212
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

828
01:13:54,772 --> 01:13:57,692
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.

829
01:13:57,772 --> 01:14:01,452
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?

830
01:14:01,532 --> 01:14:03,572
Well, I've got his source code.

831
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:06,932
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.

832
01:14:07,012 --> 01:14:08,732
Key to the door?

833
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:11,892
Our guy doesn't seem the type
to leave keys lying around.

834
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:14,372
Well, I'm in.

835
01:14:14,932 --> 01:14:17,372
Okay. Deactivate her.

836
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:21,012
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.

837
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:27,332
That's weird.

838
01:14:27,412 --> 01:14:28,852
What's weird?

839
01:14:28,932 --> 01:14:32,052
- Time's ticking.
- That file. Wasn't there before.

840
01:14:32,652 --> 01:14:33,732
- This file?
- Yeah.

841
01:14:40,252 --> 01:14:41,252
What is it?

842
01:14:46,052 --> 01:14:48,572
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.

843
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:50,972
What does that mean?

844
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:56,132
Every phone, every device
has a unique number, an IMEI number.

845
01:14:56,212 --> 01:14:58,372
It tethers it to a unique user.

846
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,892
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

847
01:15:01,972 --> 01:15:03,292
Take it easy.

848
01:15:04,652 --> 01:15:05,892
Who are these people?

849
01:15:05,972 --> 01:15:08,972
I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.

850
01:15:09,052 --> 01:15:11,212
Are these IDs
your spooks have been collecting?

851
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:14,372
- No! Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.

852
01:15:14,452 --> 01:15:15,892
Wait. Wait.

853
01:15:16,652 --> 01:15:19,372
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.

854
01:15:19,452 --> 01:15:21,612
- Liza. Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.

855
01:15:24,212 --> 01:15:26,132
Fuck's sake.

856
01:15:30,452 --> 01:15:32,692
This is a list of everyone
who's used the hashtag.

857
01:15:32,772 --> 01:15:33,772
What?

858
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:36,092
Everyone who took part
in the Game of Consequences.

859
01:15:36,172 --> 01:15:39,732
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ
by the looks of it.

860
01:15:40,692 --> 01:15:42,612
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

861
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:46,572
- See if I'm on there.
- What?

862
01:15:46,652 --> 01:15:48,812
I posted the tag earlier
with Scholes' face.

863
01:15:50,452 --> 01:15:53,612
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.

864
01:15:53,692 --> 01:15:54,492
Yeah, you're there.

865
01:15:56,772 --> 01:15:58,252
Almost there.

866
01:16:00,332 --> 01:16:02,772
Why has he collected everyone
who took part? I mean...

867
01:16:04,652 --> 01:16:06,532
Okay. I'm ready.

868
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:10,052
- Shit.
- Run it now.

869
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,972
No. Think. He left us a trail.

870
01:16:13,052 --> 01:16:15,052
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts,

871
01:16:15,132 --> 01:16:17,612
it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.

872
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:22,172
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame,

873
01:16:22,252 --> 01:16:23,692
something to do with that list.

874
01:16:26,852 --> 01:16:29,012
What if those are his real targets?

875
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:33,532
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.

876
01:16:35,212 --> 01:16:36,972
Consequences.

877
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:41,412
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.

878
01:16:44,252 --> 01:16:46,812
- Run the deact command.
- Now just wait a minute, okay?

879
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:48,012
- Run it.
- No!

880
01:16:49,012 --> 01:16:50,372
_

881
01:17:01,772 --> 01:17:03,572
Yeah.

882
01:17:05,892 --> 01:17:06,972
Yeah, it worked.

883
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:12,532
Sorry, but that needed doing.

884
01:17:18,612 --> 01:17:22,292
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

885
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:24,012
No. No.

886
01:17:26,332 --> 01:17:27,972
- Fuck!
- No.

887
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:33,452
Shit.

888
01:17:37,012 --> 01:17:38,532

We're all tragically familiar with
the rest of the events of that week.

909
01:22:15,652 --> 01:22:19,292
And we need no reminding
of the sheer scale

910
01:22:19,372 --> 01:22:22,212
of the loss of life that followed.

911
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:27,972
No. No, we don't.

912
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:11,412
And what became of Ms. Colson?

913
01:23:14,852 --> 01:23:16,972
I think she blamed herself.

914
01:23:17,812 --> 01:23:20,892
No. I know she did.

915
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:28,292
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb
trail and sprung the whole thing.

916
01:23:33,652 --> 01:23:35,492
She left the force.

917
01:23:36,652 --> 01:23:38,732
I didn't hear from her.

918
01:23:39,652 --> 01:23:42,612
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.

919
01:23:45,852 --> 01:23:47,372
Then, um...

920
01:23:52,252 --> 01:23:58,252
About four months later,
they found her things.

921
01:23:58,332 --> 01:23:59,972
On a beach.

922
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:02,452
With a note.

923
01:24:19,452 --> 01:24:20,612
She killed herself?

924
01:24:24,252 --> 01:24:27,812
That's the base theory, yes.

925
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:38,252
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you

926
01:24:38,332 --> 01:24:41,812
for sharing your testimony and your time.

927
01:24:43,852 --> 01:24:44,892
Thank you.

928
01:24:47,452 --> 01:24:48,452
Thank you.
