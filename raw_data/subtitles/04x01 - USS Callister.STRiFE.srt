2
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,618
- Captain Daly.
- Report.

3
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:40,226
A non-federation vessel jumped straight
out of white space right in front of us.

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,878
- Valdack.
- That can't be.

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,438
My data scan indicates a heavily
armored Gorgan Dreadnought,

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,118
vessel ID number 9864321.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,438
Thank you, Dudani. Valdack must
have hijacked it from the Fermi hub

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,840
and tracked our position.

9
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:56,843
- Tulaska, shield status?
- Shields 100%.

10
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:58,398
- Helmsman Packer?
- Captain.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,478
- Prime rear thrusters.
- Rear thrusters primed.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,158
If that's Valdack,
he'll rip us to shreds.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,351
Captain, we have to surrender.
There's no other way.

14
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:07,838
Let's not lose our
heads, Lieutenant Walton.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,478
Shields at 68%.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,638
Heavy damage reported,
decks six through ten.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,156
Fires in med center and major
rupture to cargo bay Alpha.

18
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,318
We've got no choice!

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,798
Do you want me to open comms
with Valdack's craft, Captain?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,320
Negative.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,800
- Shields at 54%.
- There's no way out.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,840
- Captain, please.
- Not now, Walton.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,867
Helmsman Packer, take us into
that asteroid gas cluster.

24
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,518
- Into the cluster?
- That's suicide, sir.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,038
It is our only chance.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,703
That gas cluster is charged
with ionized pyron particles.

27
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:45,838
If our shields hold, we can use them
to increase our photon intensity.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,398
Packer, increase thrusters.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,554
Shields at 43%.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,118
It'll tear the ship apart, Captain!

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,798
Walton, you are a Space Fleet
officer. Act accordingly.

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,038
- Shields at 32%.
- Valdack's not following.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,520
Packer, turn us around.

34
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:07,065
- Tulaska, charge photon bolts.
- Bolts charged, Captain.

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Fire!

36
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:23,358
His hull's breached, shields
gone. He's defenseless.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,218
- Lieutenant Lowry, open comms.
- He's already hailing us, Captain.

38
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:27,678
On screen.

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,640
Captain Daly, may you drown in
the venom of 900 Tragorian snakes!

40
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:34,878
You are defeated, Valdack.

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,038
Return the plasmorthian crystal
and we'll cause you no more damage.

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,678
You must think me a fool, Captain!

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,238
I know the crystal's capabilities,
and I will die before I give it up!

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,000
I gave you a chance,
Valdack, showed you mercy.

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,664
Reflect on that while you can.

46
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,227
Close comms.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,318
- Tulaska, destroy his ship.
- Yes, Captain.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,358
- That was incredible, Captain.
- You saved our lives.

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,558
I'm so sorry I lost
it back there, Captain.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,609
Not for the first time, Walton.

51
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,901
And I should know by
now never to doubt you.

52
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:14,304
Please forgive me.

53
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,906
At ease, Walton.

54
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,476
Captain, sensors indicate
an escape pod ejected

55
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,359
from Valdack's ship before detonation.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,798
He's escaping with the crystal.

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,840
You want me to plot a
pursuit course, Captain?

58
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:27,212
No.

59
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,593
We'll let him go... for now.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,478
- Great decision-making, Captain.
- Three cheers for Captain Daly.

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,484
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,398
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,638
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,918
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,890
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

66
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:55,438
♪ And so say all of us ♪

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,187
God bless you, Captain. God bless you.

68
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,330
Thirteenth floor.

69
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,891
- Welcome to Callister.
- Oh.

70
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:13,094
Excuse me.

71
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,100
Excuse me.

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,343
Hey.

73
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,670
Uh... Elena, my pass doesn't work.

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,758
You must renew on first of each month.

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah, I know that, but the
first was on the weekend, so...

76
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,400
OK.

77
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Thank you.

78
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,078
You're welcome.

79
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,518
Prepare to enter

80
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,367
the most immersive gaming
experience in years,

81
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,766
Infinity, from Callister Inc.

82
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,087
- Morning, Mr. Daly.
- Helmsman Packer.

83
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,090
Huh?

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,278
Uh, I mean, Mr. Packer. Nate.

85
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,400
OK.

86
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,282
Are you making coffees?

87
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:16,285
Yeah.

88
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,629
Do you think maybe you
could make me one too?

89
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:26,377
Sure, sure. Uh, what do you want?

90
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:29,649
Just vanilla latte. Skim milk.

91
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,132
Yeah, good call. 'Cause...

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,038
those are very, very big numbers.

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,998
We might just have to hold you
to that. Well, no, yes, of course.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,438
Sure. Yes.

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
Oh, are you OK, man?

96
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,807
I guess you didn't see my gym bag.

97
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,878
Here. Come on.

98
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,238
- I'm sorry, bud.
- OK.

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
You left it...

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,558
You're gonna do it for
me and make it good.

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
You know you are a god to me at least.

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,880
Oh. The ladies' bathroom is that
way. The sign's kind of confusing.

103
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:34,168
You're Robert Daly, right?

104
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:38,012
- Right.
- Yeah, hi.

105
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,177
I'm Nanette, Nanette Cole.

106
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
Um...

107
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:45,266
I started here today,
coding on the update,

108
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:49,507
and I just wanted to,
uh, pass on my admiration

109
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:53,295
to the person who
actually designed Infinity.

110
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:56,455
The procedural algorithm is amazing.

111
00:06:56,457 --> 00:07:00,312
It's just some beautiful code.

112
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:02,055
Thank you.

113
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:05,777
That's actually the reason
that I wanted to work here.

114
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:11,695
- You must be busy. I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's fine.

115
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,135
- Sorry.
- No.

116
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:16,175
Well, just fangirling. Sorry. Um...

117
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,017
Ooh... vintage.

118
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:23,775
- Yeah, it's Space Fleet.
- Wow.

119
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,551
It's a TV show. Before your time.

120
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:29,828
Before my time, actually.

121
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,577
But it was... visionary.

122
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,415
Is this on, like, tape?

123
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:39,781
Yeah, I've got the
VHS, the DVD, Blu-ray.

124
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:43,351
The whole thing. Seasons one to six.

125
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:45,417
Netflix has it these days, but...

126
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,775
Aboard the spaceship USS Callister.

127
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:50,375
- OK, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:53,095
So... OK, so Callister
is like the, uh...

129
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,359
Yeah, when we set up the company, um...

130
00:07:57,217 --> 00:08:02,855
I suggested we call it Callister
as kind of a little tribute.

131
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:07,577
Walton didn't really get the
reference, but he let me have that one.

132
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,815
Mini-skirted damsels.

133
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,815
A little cold for that in space.

134
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:22,295
That is just what a Bargradian
sand warrior would say.

135
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,570
Bob, Christmas is closing
in like a goddamn meteor.

136
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,411
We've got customers all over our
balls waiting for the Infinity update.

137
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:32,975
Tell me it's gonna be up and
running before the weekend.

138
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:36,855
- Oh, I'll ask Kabir...
- You're CTO. Don't ask anybody anything.

139
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,655
You should be telling people things
like I'm telling you right now.

140
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:41,481
- I'll talk to him.
- Good.

141
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:42,777
- I'm sorry.
- OK.

142
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:45,095
- Hello.
- Hello.

143
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:47,455
Sorry, I couldn't find
a good moment to...

144
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:50,415
Oh, you must be new. Uh... I'm
James Walton. I run the company.

145
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,575
- I...
- Well, we run the company, kind of.

146
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:56,417
Bob here is the hardware,
and I am the shiny front end.

147
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,695
- I'm Nanette Cole.
- Which department?

148
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:02,375
- Engine architecture.
- And it's your first day?

149
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,455
Uh...

150
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:05,857
- Yeah.
- Have you had the tour?

151
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,335
No, I...

152
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,337
Please, allow me.

153
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:12,737
OK.

154
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:19,054
It was so nice to meet you.

155
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,255
Just a little bit.

156
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:25,375
It's a different
environment I set up here.

157
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:28,815
People call it a carefree
environment. I call it "care-full."

158
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,735
- Interesting.
- Not scary.

159
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,817
Dudani?

160
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:41,015
Kabir?

161
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:43,215
Mm. Mr. Daly.

162
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:46,815
Do you have the latest
ETA on the update patch?

163
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:49,095
It's just there's still
some runtime errors.

164
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:51,656
Well, the thing is, we could have
it ready by end of play today,

165
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,135
but if we had time, we could
alter the trading mechanics,

166
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,535
tweak the critical hit system, but
of course, that'd add another week,

167
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,097
maybe ten days or so.

168
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:04,177
Mr. Daly?

169
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:10,817
- Yeah. Yeah, do all of that, thank you.
- I'll... OK, we're on it.

170
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,215
Welcome back, Captain.

171
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,335
Have you located Valdack's position?

172
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,855
Not yet, but our sensors are
scanning every star system

173
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,335
between here and Valatros.

174
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,337
So your answer is no?

175
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:49,097
Uh...

176
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:51,655
I'm afraid so, sir.

177
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,617
You... are pathetic,
Walton. What are you?

178
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:06,217
What's that?

179
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:09,817
Pathetic.

180
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:21,415
So Valdack's out there somewhere

181
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:24,497
and you village idiots
are asleep at the wheel.

182
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:31,215
You're not just disgraceful,
you're disgusting, all of you.

183
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:35,097
So can you do one thing?

184
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:38,297
Can you find Valdack?

185
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,894
I'm not asking. I'm
telling you! Understand?

186
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,895
- Hmm?
- Yes.

187
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,575
- Yes?
- Yes, Captain. Yeah.

188
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:51,697
- Yes.
- Aye, Captain.

189
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:53,457
Huh?

190
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,937
Well, all right.

191
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,637
Tulaska, check security protocols.

192
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,415
If they've expired, you're in trouble.

193
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,215
Yes, Captain.

194
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:09,735
Dudani, recheck those probe results.

195
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:12,135
- No room for errors.
- Of course, Captain.

196
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:13,897
- Helmsman Packer?
- Captain.

197
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:16,537
Vanilla latte.

198
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,897
- Skim milk.
- At once.

199
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,337
Walton.

200
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:39,615
Exit game.

201
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,855
Hi, Nanette. You feel like you
have everything you need here?

202
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:03,775
Mm-hmm.

203
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,415
- All right. That's a nice sweater.
- Oh. Thank you.

204
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,097
Cashmere?

205
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:15,017
Mr. Daly, got that new
ETA on the update patch.

206
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:17,775
- New ETA?
- Yeah, it's all good.

207
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:20,015
But now we're looking at
December 24th for rollout.

208
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,935
We don't patch until Christmas Eve?

209
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:24,417
Well, yeah, I mean, with
the alterations you approved.

210
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:32,735
OK, OK. Thank you.

211
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:33,737
OK.

212
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:41,070
- Hi, Robert.
- Hi.

213
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:44,337
Um, I was just gonna fix
a coffee. Do you want one?

214
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,718
- Sure.
- OK.

215
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:52,137
Um... vanilla latte with skim milk.

216
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:55,497
- Okey-dokes.
- OK.

217
00:14:58,737 --> 00:14:59,897
Absolutely.

218
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,575
Mm-hmm.

219
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:05,895
Well, yes, they are great numbers.

220
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,537
OK. Mm-hmm.

221
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:10,015
Ta-ta.

222
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:12,177
Total fucking shitwit.

223
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:17,095
- Do you want coffee?
- Um, Brushed Suede. Thank you.

224
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:19,417
So how are you settling
in? Are you settling in?

225
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,975
Uh, yeah, yeah. Everyone
here is really friendly.

226
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:29,817
And um... it is not like
my last job, thank God.

227
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,130
- Yeah?
- It was a toxic workplace, you know.

228
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:37,531
My boss was a major-league bully and...

229
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,415
- It's not like here, like with Mr...
- Walton.

230
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,895
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. He's a really good guy.

231
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:44,234
He's a bit of a player.

232
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,605
Chuck a sandwich across the room,

233
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:47,255
he'll fuck it before it hits the ground,

234
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,895
but he's basically an all right bloke.

235
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:54,895
OK. Well, there's uh... two
bosses here anyway, so I guess...

236
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:57,577
- Two how?
- Robert Daly.

237
00:15:58,217 --> 00:15:59,575
Oh!

238
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:02,535
I mean, well, yeah, technically.

239
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:05,415
Mr. Daly is actually the
whole reason that I'm here.

240
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,375
- Really? Interesting.
- I mean...

241
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:11,055
Who wouldn't wanna work under an
incredible mind like that, you know?

242
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:14,430
His coding is... It's sublime.

243
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,737
Do you have a thing for him?

244
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:21,055
Daly? No, no. No. It's not like that.

245
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:23,695
It's purely... It's professional.

246
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:25,255
I like his code.

247
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:27,615
Ah. Fucking hell, I
was gonna say, you know,

248
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:30,297
don't be too nice to him
'cause he gets a bit starey.

249
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,508
Mm.

250
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:36,975
Wide berth, that's
my advice. Wide berth.

251
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:38,055
- OK.
- Yeah.

252
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,377
Thank you.

253
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,817
- There you go.
- Thank you.

254
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,655
- Bye.
- No bye. I'm coming.

255
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,295
No. Suck a dick, Karl.

256
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:20,697
Later, guys.

257
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,457
Welcome to Callister.

258
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,535
Thank you.

259
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:51,577
You're welcome.

260
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,377
Goddamn it, Robert!

261
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:04,377
- Christmas Eve. Really?
- Uh...

262
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:06,217
Not OK.

263
00:19:55,017 --> 00:19:56,017
Oh.

264
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:24,977
Hello?

265
00:21:30,577 --> 00:21:34,817
Oh, boy. It looks like there's
a new girl in the office.

266
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,365
What's your name, hon?

267
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:40,935
Come in. Let me fix you a drink.

268
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:45,095
We have everything from
Bengarian phlegm shots to uh...

269
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:48,175
ooh, distilled root blood
from the Cangor quadrant.

270
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:52,097
What's your poison? Some of this
actually is poison, so don't be shy.

271
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,097
Am I dreaming?

272
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:58,775
Yeah, no, no, 'fraid not.

273
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,137
- I remember dreaming.
- Me too.

274
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:03,815
But where am I?

275
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:06,375
This is the USS Callister,
Space Fleet's finest,

276
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,754
exploring the furthest reaches
of the known universe and beyond.

277
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:14,335
We are its loyal space crew and
now, apparently, so are you. Cheers.

278
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:18,415
Your name? Babe, what's your name?

279
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,017
Nanette. We've met.

280
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:25,017
Maybe, in the real world. I
wouldn't have no way of knowing.

281
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:29,175
- What do you mean?
- You'd better sit down.

282
00:22:29,177 --> 00:22:31,657
No, I don't... I don't wanna sit down.

283
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,375
I wanna know what's going on.

284
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:36,294
You're on board Robert Daly's ship.

285
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:39,215
Robert Daly, the CTO?

286
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:42,215
Here he's Captain Daly,
our fearless leader.

287
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:45,017
Yeah, you're seriously gonna
need to sit the fuck down.

288
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:47,825
- Uh...
- Welcome.

289
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:53,335
You are um... Hey, hey. You're
the intern from work, right? Nate?

290
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:55,375
Packer. Nate Packer.

291
00:22:55,377 --> 00:22:58,457
Wait. So I'm still just
the intern out there?

292
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:00,775
Jesus.

293
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:03,055
You're um... You're... You're...

294
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:05,137
Dudani. Diagnostics.

295
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,217
- Welcome.
- Right.

296
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:15,095
- You're the receptionist, right?
- Elena.

297
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:18,295
- Your skin is blue.
- Weird blue alien skin, I know.

298
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,977
It's fucked up.

299
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:22,257
Almost sort of racist.

300
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:27,666
OK. Walt, fix her something,

301
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:29,775
something she'll recognize. Vodka.

302
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:32,215
- Hey. So what's it like out there now?
- What?

303
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:34,255
- What year is it?
- Don't do her head in.

304
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:38,177
- What?
- What year? I... saw you today.

305
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,655
Ooh. Did you see me?
Did I look thin? Hmm?

306
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:43,217
Like, wheatgrass yogurt thin?

307
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:45,975
Can we not pop her fucking mind?

308
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:49,215
Someone needs to be
straight with me right now.

309
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:52,217
OK. OK, listen.

310
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:53,995
This is Infinity.

311
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:59,895
That's what we're all inside.
That's where all of this exists.

312
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,257
Infinity, the game?

313
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:05,455
Daly's got his own modded
version of Infinity,

314
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,650
reskinned to look like
his favorite TV show.

315
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:10,575
- Space Thing? Space Thing?
- Space Fleet.

316
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:13,217
- Hence the groovy decor.
- And this tasteful get-up.

317
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:15,375
Infinity.

318
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:18,295
That's an online game, like
a multiplayer deal. This...

319
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:22,817
This is his development build,
sealed off so he can control it.

320
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:24,386
He keeps it offline

321
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:27,015
so the custom code he's written
can't be detected and deleted.

322
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:30,897
Mm. Yes, it's a bubble universe,
ruled by an asshole god.

323
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:33,497
He...

324
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,680
put us in... in here?

325
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:38,637
Mm-hmm.

326
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,760
Drink your vodka.

327
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:43,377
- How do we get out?
- No, really, drink it.

328
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,257
Drink it.

329
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:51,615
- You can't leave.
- What?

330
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:52,897
None of us can.

331
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:56,297
- Because you're not actually you.
- What?

332
00:24:56,977 --> 00:25:00,888
I know it's mental, but
you're a copy of you.

333
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:02,535
- A digital clone.
- No.

334
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:05,575
No, I am... I'm me. I am me.

335
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,295
- I'm me.
- No, not the real you.

336
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:11,657
Daly's created an identical digital
version of you, of all of us.

337
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:15,095
From your DNA. He'll
have harvested it somehow.

338
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,735
He told me he got mine from
the rim of a smoothie cup.

339
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:19,775
He retrieved Packer's
juices from the bathroom.

340
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:22,455
Man, you have got to let that
go. She does not need details.

341
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:23,743
Basically he's got a gizmo...

342
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:26,054
I theorize an advanced
biometric DNA virtual clone.

343
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,055
He's got a fucking
gizmo. That's what I said.

344
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:30,855
He fed your DNA in, he
put you inside his computer

345
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:33,137
and, bam, you pop up
here like a Pop-Tart.

346
00:25:33,857 --> 00:25:35,935
Yeah, we've all been through it.

347
00:25:35,937 --> 00:25:40,255
He brings us in for different
reasons, shit we did in the office.

348
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:41,724
I called him out for staring.

349
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,655
I reset admin permissions on
a test build for 14 minutes.

350
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,375
Insufficient smiling.

351
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:49,575
- I brought him the wrong sandwich.
- OK, never mind the reasons.

352
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:52,255
The point is that we're
stuck in Daly's playground,

353
00:25:52,257 --> 00:25:54,055
and that's all you need to know.

354
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:58,021
This is a dream. Yeah, it has to be.

355
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,169
It's more like an eternal waking

356
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:03,339
nightmare from which there is no escape.

357
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:08,095
- No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.
- Oh, for fuck's sake,

358
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:09,775
I'm trying to break her in gently.

359
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,883
The quicker she gets
it, the easier it'll be.

360
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:15,055
Daddy's home.

361
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:16,497
He'll be here any moment.

362
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:19,055
No. I'm gonna get out of here.

363
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:21,055
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You
gotta stay on the bridge.

364
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,175
He controls everything.

365
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,055
- He does shit to make us cooperate.
- Get off.

366
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:26,975
- You have no idea. I'm trying to help.
- Just leave it.

367
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:28,975
He's gonna fuck us up
if she doesn't play ball.

368
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:32,097
Yes, well, she's gonna have to work
it out for herself, like we all did.

369
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,817
There's gotta be a way out. Come on.

370
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:07,135
Lieutenant Cole, welcome aboard.

371
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:11,695
Crew, we have a new member of the
team, Science Officer Nanette Cole.

372
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,695
Please, take your post.

373
00:27:13,697 --> 00:27:18,055
I believe we've finally managed to
track Valdack to an uncharted planet.

374
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:20,575
- No.
- Take your post. That is an order.

375
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:23,367
I'm not doing this.

376
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,495
The whole thing's much better
if you let yourself get into it.

377
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:32,015
If you think that I'm playing along
with your Space Force bullshit...

378
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,855
- Space Fleet.
- Whatever.

379
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:36,328
- You can think again.
- This is my ship.

380
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:40,937
- I am your captain. An order is an order.
- Then go fuck yourself.

381
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:43,415
Sir.

382
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:47,417
OK. So we're doing it this way.

383
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:52,937
Are you gonna throw a fireball?

384
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:09,735
Oh, dear. You can't
see. You can't breathe.

385
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:10,857
Unpleasant, isn't it?

386
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:14,977
Do you submit?

387
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,857
You won't die, you know.

388
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:22,697
No one dies in here
unless I want them to.

389
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:28,095
I can keep you like this
forever if I feel like it.

390
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:32,095
Forever gasping for breath
with a mouth that isn't there.

391
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:34,695
Do you submit?

392
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,537
Good girl.

393
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:51,017
Lieutenant Cole, Valdack's hideout.
Triangulate the signal, please.

394
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,649
It's any button. They're all the same.

395
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,095
Well?

396
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:21,015
I'm getting a signal
from a class five planet.

397
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:23,257
- Rannotch.
- Rannoch.

398
00:29:24,377 --> 00:29:26,257
Rannoch B.

399
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:30,535
Excellent. Dudani, prepare
the transmat system.

400
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:33,455
- Of course, Captain.
- Walton, Packer, Lowry, with me.

401
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:35,855
We'll transport down to the
planet, reclaim the crystal

402
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,817
and bring Valdack to justice.

403
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,815
Actually, Cole, you come too.

404
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:44,535
Perfect opportunity for you to prove

405
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:47,777
you're more than a recommendation
from Space Fleet. What do you say?

406
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:00,118
- Mr. Dudani, transport.
- Aye aye, Captain.

407
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:19,055
Breathable atmosphere.

408
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:23,617
Scanning for plasmorthian traces.

409
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,095
Crystal's this way. Let's go.

410
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:31,255
- Nate. Hey, Nate.
- Helmsman Packer, OK?

411
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:32,816
Call me Helmsman Packer.

412
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:34,375
He hates it when we don't
use our proper titles.

413
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:36,495
OK. You got a gun,
so let's take him out.

414
00:30:36,497 --> 00:30:39,255
- Then give it to me.
- OK, one, our guns don't even work.

415
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:41,748
Only his does. And two, the motherfucker

416
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:44,059
is invincible, OK? Come on, let's go.

417
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:50,257
At least you've got a gun.

418
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:56,375
- Captain.
- Shh.

419
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:59,175
We meet again, Captain Daly!

420
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:04,537
We're trapped.

421
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:06,895
Not advisable.

422
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:10,569
My plasma grenade will turn
you into screaming soup.

423
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,295
He's not going to kill us, Captain.

424
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:13,800
He had the element of surprise.

425
00:31:13,803 --> 00:31:15,735
He'd have done it
when he had the chance.

426
00:31:15,737 --> 00:31:19,135
Haven't worked out how to use
the crystal, have you, Valdack?

427
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:22,695
It's true, I require your
Space Fleet knowledge.

428
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:25,575
But it's also true that
you're gonna give it to me!

429
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:26,758
Don't be so sure.

430
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,417
- Jesus. I...
- Shh.

431
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,735
Let's see how your resolve holds up

432
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:39,255
once you're devoured one
by one by my Arachnajax!

433
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:44,377
- Holy shit. Oh, my God.
- We're all gonna die.

434
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:59,935
Killing us won't make us tell you
how the crystal works, Valdack.

435
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:03,057
We will never...

436
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:06,894
Hold on. I think my pizza's here.

437
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:10,055
Pause game.

438
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:14,335
What's happening?

439
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:16,215
You heard him. He paused the game.

440
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:19,335
'Cause he's got a pizza
delivery... out there.

441
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:28,935
Hold on.

442
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:41,855
Watch out. He'll be back soon.

443
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:45,137
Ah. That's good. This
launcher's heavy as shit.

444
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:48,615
How you holding up?

445
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,297
You know, we're existing.

446
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,697
How you doing, Gillian?

447
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:57,377
Well, yeah.

448
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:01,735
- Well, you look great.
- Her name's Gillian.

449
00:33:01,737 --> 00:33:04,055
- Did you lose weight?
- She was in marketing.

450
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:07,255
Yeah, Daly turned her into... that

451
00:33:07,257 --> 00:33:09,815
because she wouldn't play along
when he cloned her into here.

452
00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:12,815
This universe is littered
with things like her,

453
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:15,057
poor fuckers who stepped out of line.

454
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:19,177
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

455
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,055
- Here comes Captain Dick.
- Hey.

456
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:31,615
Hey. Hey.

457
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:33,615
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

458
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:34,777
Hey. Hey.

459
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:43,634
If we die, the secret of the
crystal dies with us, Valdack.

460
00:33:43,637 --> 00:33:46,695
Oh, my God. We are all gonna die!

461
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:54,497
- Valdack?
- What is it, Captain? Final words?

462
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:59,577
Over there. A naked lady.

463
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:01,295
Really?

464
00:34:07,617 --> 00:34:08,815
Great plan, Captain.

465
00:34:09,897 --> 00:34:11,857
Unparalleled tactics, Captain.

466
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:18,935
We've fought many battles,
haven't we, Captain?

467
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,340
We have.

468
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:25,337
And I've been a good
adversary for you, have I not?

469
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:31,277
Then please...

470
00:34:35,152 --> 00:34:36,377
end it.

471
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:39,817
Please.

472
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:49,575
Killing in cold blood is
against Space Fleet code.

473
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,735
I wish I could help.

474
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:00,417
Sorry, bud.

475
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:08,485
Take him to the brig.

476
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:10,735
- Dudani.
- Captain.

477
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:12,495
- Transport us aboard.
- Yes, Captain.

478
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:14,175
No more.

479
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:16,537
It's OK.

480
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:19,465
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

481
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:21,735
- Hip hip.
- Hooray!

482
00:35:23,777 --> 00:35:28,455
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪
♪ For he's a jolly fellow ♪

483
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:32,655
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

484
00:35:32,657 --> 00:35:34,537
♪ And so say... ♪ Oh, my fuck.

485
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:38,857
That wasn't very nice.

486
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,214
Today I will show you mercy.

487
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:48,935
- Great mercy-showing, Captain.
- Shh!

488
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:53,854
Tomorrow you should
reconsider your... amenability.

489
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:56,737
I may not be feeling so benevolent.

490
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,817
Exit game.

491
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:06,377
- Oh. Fucking hell.
- This was tense.

492
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:08,857
I don't like tense.

493
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,697
- Drink?
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:15,575
So how was the mission?

495
00:36:15,577 --> 00:36:18,105
Wasn't too bad. Usual
standoff storyline.

496
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:21,175
- Ooh. Saw Gillian from marketing. Yeah.
- Oh.

497
00:36:21,177 --> 00:36:24,295
There is no way that I
am kissing that asshole.

498
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:26,335
Then he's just gonna
get more and more pissed.

499
00:36:26,337 --> 00:36:28,855
- How about you kiss him, then?
- You get used to it.

500
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:30,495
It's... There's no tongues.

501
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:32,676
If that's any consolation,
there's never any tongues.

502
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,095
- Doing tongues is not Space Fleet way.
- Mm.

503
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:37,495
It's not like it can go
beyond kissing anyway.

504
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:38,577
What do you mean?

505
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,895
Oh. You haven't noticed?

506
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:45,335
What are you doing?

507
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,935
Please. Please, don't do that. Don't...

508
00:36:47,937 --> 00:36:49,095
Oh, my God.

509
00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:51,020
- Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Yes.

510
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:54,935
There's no genitals in Space
Fleet. This is a wholesome universe.

511
00:36:54,937 --> 00:36:57,135
He must have modified our code that way.

512
00:36:57,137 --> 00:37:01,098
Mm. We're all the same. If you don't
believe me, take a look down there.

513
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:03,821
We have tried grinding our mounds
together out of sheer boredom.

514
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:09,057
- No sensation at all.
- Can't even shit.

515
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:13,638
Can't even have the basic fucking
pleasure of pushing out a shit.

516
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,601
I miss taking shit.

517
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:17,617
OK.

518
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:24,255
Stealing my pussy is a red fucking line.

519
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:26,775
- We are gonna get this bastard!
- No.

520
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,535
- Yeah.
- We've tried a million times.

521
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:30,737
No way out.

522
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,975
Walton. Come on, Walton.

523
00:37:33,977 --> 00:37:36,455
Like I said, he's an asshole god.

524
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:37,497
Mnh-mnh.

525
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,857
Daly's smart, but he's not a god.

526
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:44,057
He's a coder.

527
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:46,537
He is fallible.

528
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:55,024
Kabir, what was that thing he was

529
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:57,975
holding in his hand, that scanner thing?

530
00:37:57,977 --> 00:38:00,295
His omnicorder, primary
communications device.

531
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:02,695
You said he kept his
version of the game offline.

532
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,760
But the omnicorder made contact with

533
00:38:04,763 --> 00:38:06,935
the outside world when the pizza came,

534
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:10,095
so it's gotta be connected
to his home system at least.

535
00:38:10,097 --> 00:38:11,255
The omnicorder's gone.

536
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:12,677
It loads when he loads, and it goes

537
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,215
when he goes, and that's the only one.

538
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:15,405
No.

539
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:19,095
There has got to be a way to connect.

540
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:23,217
You won't hack it. I've tried.

541
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:25,535
I haven't.

542
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:40,726
Bingo.

543
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:45,295
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

544
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:47,255
- This is part of Infinity's front end.
- Yeah.

545
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:49,535
You can invite a friend
with a custom message.

546
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:52,815
- A message to outside?
- Just one. 140 characters maximum.

547
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,537
So who are you gonna contact?

548
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:09,255
Thirteenth floor. Welcome to Callister.

549
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:11,337
- Hey, Elena.
- Hi.

550
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:25,495
- You need me buzz you in?
- What? Uh, no, no, I...

551
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,015
- I got that for you.
- Oh. Thank you.

552
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:27,935
After you.

553
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,495
Um...

554
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,375
Mr. Daly, hi.

555
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:36,377
Hi.

556
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:38,857
Can I talk to you for a second?

557
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:47,166
Did you just send me an Infinity invite?

558
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,775
Wha... No.

559
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:52,895
It was really weird. It
had a message attached.

560
00:39:52,897 --> 00:39:55,897
Something about people
trapped in a game.

561
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:00,405
Probably just a spambot. Firewall
doesn't always get them all.

562
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:03,337
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it.

563
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,952
You didn't open the link, did you?

564
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:08,095
Oh, God, no.

565
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:11,177
- Maybe upgrade your security software.
- All right.

566
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:14,017
Have a good one.

567
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,297
That's the thing there.

568
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,095
Oh, yeah.

569
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:37,415
Could you please,
please cut that shit out?

570
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,577
I'm trying to make it like a hobby.

571
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:43,775
Oh, that's good.

572
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:47,895
That is way too early. He's
only been at work a few hours.

573
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:51,615
She got the message!

574
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:54,335
I did. It's me.

575
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:57,015
That's me or the cops most likely.

576
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:58,617
Oh. We are getting out of here!

577
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:26,088
What is Space Fleet?

578
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:30,885
I'll tell you what it is.

579
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:35,497
It is a belief system...

580
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,817
founded on the very
best of human nature.

581
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:47,091
It is a goal for us to strive towards

582
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:51,337
for the betterment of the universe,

583
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:54,773
for the betterment of life itself.

584
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:04,015
And you assholes are fucking it up!

585
00:42:04,017 --> 00:42:05,537
I did it. I did. I did it.

586
00:42:06,497 --> 00:42:09,417
I sent the message. It was me.

587
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:13,655
No one else was involved, I swear.

588
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,695
I tried the carrot. Now meet the stick.

589
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:18,617
No, this is gonna make you
happy, Daly, 'cause you're sick.

590
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,307
And you need help.

591
00:42:23,297 --> 00:42:24,417
No, don't, don't!

592
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:26,057
Captain.

593
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:29,097
Captain, please.

594
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:33,855
OK, look, she's new. She'll behave.

595
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:35,217
We'll all behave.

596
00:42:37,297 --> 00:42:40,137
Just let her off. Let her off this once.

597
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,457
Please.

598
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,095
OK.

599
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,018
OK.

600
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:51,252
OK.

601
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,817
No! Daly, no! No, no, no, no!

602
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,817
You know what makes me happy?

603
00:43:21,538 --> 00:43:23,816
The look on your face right now.

604
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,975
Dudani, Walton, Tulaska, take this
thing to the brig with Valdack.

605
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:32,577
Packer, find a barren
planet we can dump her on.

606
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:41,695
And you... can just stay here
and think about your attitude.

607
00:43:41,697 --> 00:43:43,817
Exit game.

608
00:44:44,497 --> 00:44:45,617
Update patch.

609
00:44:49,217 --> 00:44:50,537
The update patch.

610
00:44:52,337 --> 00:44:53,537
It's there, there.

611
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:57,535
- So what? It's a wormhole.
- Unh-unh.

612
00:44:57,537 --> 00:45:00,695
That is the Christmas update
patch preinstalling itself.

613
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:04,015
The wormhole... it's just how
the game is expressing the uplink.

614
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:04,935
So?

615
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:07,655
Daly's custom build is still
connected to the internet.

616
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:08,633
Some way.

617
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:10,175
If this is another one of your plans,

618
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:12,855
just stop before somebody
else gets monsterfied.

619
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:14,735
No, no, this... this can work.

620
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:17,975
We can't get all-in access from the
ship. He'll have crippled permissions.

621
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:21,895
Yes, but what if we
fly into the wormhole?

622
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:25,335
- Like, on purpose?
- We'd hit the system firewall.

623
00:45:25,337 --> 00:45:28,575
- Exactly. Yeah.
- And have our rogue coding deleted.

624
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:30,855
- Deleted as in...?
- As in die.

625
00:45:30,857 --> 00:45:32,459
Whether it's dying would depend on

626
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:34,335
your position regarding sentient code...

627
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:38,257
We would cease to exist,
that's true. But we'd be free.

628
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:41,817
We'd be... free.

629
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:47,015
This is academic since we have no
means of getting to the wormhole.

630
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:49,295
There's no way to pilot the
damn thing without Daly here

631
00:45:49,297 --> 00:45:51,295
and he can stop us like that.

632
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:54,135
What about if he's
logged in but on pause?

633
00:45:54,137 --> 00:45:56,615
Like when his pizza came,
he was just frozen there.

634
00:45:56,617 --> 00:45:59,575
Flying would be possible, but that
wormhole's a whole parsec away.

635
00:45:59,577 --> 00:46:01,215
We'd never reach it before he got back.

636
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,295
Unless we stalled him for longer.

637
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:04,575
And that we do how?

638
00:46:04,577 --> 00:46:08,575
If we can get Daly's omnicorder,
we can make a phone call, right?

639
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:10,135
Theoretically, yes, but...

640
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:12,118
If we can get real me on the phone

641
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:14,495
again, I, um... I may
have some leverage.

642
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:16,657
- Leverage? On yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:46:18,137 --> 00:46:22,135
- Like what?
- My PhotoCloud account.

644
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:23,935
I know the password, obviously.

645
00:46:23,937 --> 00:46:25,937
There are some pretty...

646
00:46:28,337 --> 00:46:30,364
interesting images
on there that I should

647
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,295
have deleted a while ago, but I didn't.

648
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:35,695
So, we can blackmail me.

649
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:37,741
I'm pretty sure that I'd do anything

650
00:46:37,744 --> 00:46:39,736
to keep those photos from getting out.

651
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:41,055
Must be pretty pictures.

652
00:46:41,057 --> 00:46:46,257
Look, if this is going to work,
we all have to be in on it.

653
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:49,135
OK?

654
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:53,095
Flying into certain death in a wormhole

655
00:46:53,097 --> 00:46:55,657
beats another 10,000
years with Captain Ass.

656
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:58,657
- I'm in.
- OK.

657
00:47:01,177 --> 00:47:02,353
Me too.

658
00:47:04,057 --> 00:47:05,777
Also me.

659
00:47:07,817 --> 00:47:10,822
Well, I am out.

660
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,535
Daly won. Daly's always won.

661
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:20,255
We just have to get on with it...
'cause we don't have a chance.

662
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:22,535
- Yes, we do.
- Hmm?

663
00:47:22,537 --> 00:47:27,095
We fly into the wormhole
and we are extinct.

664
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:30,275
We are gone. We are rid of his shit.

665
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:31,497
Sounds peachy.

666
00:47:32,297 --> 00:47:33,417
What is with you?

667
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:39,501
Don't you wanna fight back?
Why won't you fight back?

668
00:47:39,504 --> 00:47:40,650
Tommy.

669
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:43,657
- Who is Tommy?
- He's my son.

670
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:49,217
He's six years old, at least
he was when I woke up in here.

671
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:54,457
See, in the early days of this
ship, it was just me and Daly.

672
00:47:56,777 --> 00:47:58,897
I was his pet project.

673
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:02,217
He tried everything to break me,

674
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:06,737
and I withstood it all
'cause I just thought

675
00:48:07,337 --> 00:48:12,015
there was still a chance I could
get out and see my boy again.

676
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:14,457
In a way, I was right, I
did get to see him again.

677
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:17,977
Just not the real him.

678
00:48:20,937 --> 00:48:22,937
Daly told me what happened.

679
00:48:24,337 --> 00:48:29,937
Back on the outside, the real me,
uh... brought Tommy to work one day,

680
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:32,455
showed him around.

681
00:48:32,457 --> 00:48:34,497
He would've loved seeing
all those computers.

682
00:48:35,897 --> 00:48:37,537
He's really into that stuff.

683
00:48:38,577 --> 00:48:42,737
Anyway, evidently... Tommy
had a lollipop that day.

684
00:48:46,377 --> 00:48:47,737
That's all Daly needed.

685
00:48:55,697 --> 00:48:58,417
He copied him in here.

686
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:00,737
It was Tommy all right.

687
00:49:03,057 --> 00:49:04,775
He was alike in every way.

688
00:49:04,777 --> 00:49:05,857
Dad!

689
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:08,615
Daddy...

690
00:49:08,617 --> 00:49:10,097
You know what he did to him?

691
00:49:12,337 --> 00:49:13,295
Tommy!

692
00:49:13,297 --> 00:49:16,255
He took Tommy and he threw
him out of the airlock.

693
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:19,095
- Tommy!
- Daddy!

694
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:25,055
- Right out into space.
- Daddy! No!

695
00:49:25,057 --> 00:49:26,402
And he made me watch.

696
00:49:29,537 --> 00:49:31,497
Tommy!

697
00:49:34,777 --> 00:49:37,737
Have you ever seen an unsuited
body compress in space?

698
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,177
They freeze...

699
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:48,169
and crack like a porcelain doll.

700
00:50:01,257 --> 00:50:04,455
I take my hat off to Daly.

701
00:50:04,457 --> 00:50:07,937
The detail in this place is exceptional.

702
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:15,575
And he said he'd do it again and again,

703
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:18,175
'cause Daly's still got Tommy's DNA.

704
00:50:18,177 --> 00:50:20,017
He's got all of our DNA.

705
00:50:20,657 --> 00:50:24,297
He keeps it in his bedroom in a
fucking mini fridge by his desk.

706
00:50:25,258 --> 00:50:28,338
So I have to stay in line,

707
00:50:29,297 --> 00:50:33,015
because even if we die in
here, he can bring us back.

708
00:50:33,017 --> 00:50:36,337
He can bring Tommy
back whenever he wants.

709
00:50:37,817 --> 00:50:40,017
And God knows how he'd
take it out on him.

710
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:43,697
God knows what he'd do.

711
00:50:45,657 --> 00:50:49,697
So, you see, what choice do I have?

712
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:58,297
Walton.

713
00:51:00,297 --> 00:51:03,415
We are gonna get that fucking lollipop.

714
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:07,977
But you gotta believe me.

715
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:11,537
Can you do that?

716
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:16,257
Can you?

717
00:51:57,497 --> 00:51:59,617
Good to see you at your position, Cole.

718
00:52:01,234 --> 00:52:03,981
Captain, you've come
at just the right time.

719
00:52:04,977 --> 00:52:06,161
I have?

720
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,815
I'm picking up a distress signal
from the surface of Skillane IV.

721
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,257
Looks like a crashed shuttle.

722
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,577
What should we do?

723
00:52:23,537 --> 00:52:26,777
Space Fleet never turns its
back on those who need our help.

724
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:30,975
- Dudani, set a course for Skillane IV.
- Aye aye, sir.

725
00:52:30,977 --> 00:52:33,735
We'll send a search
party. Packer, Tulaska...

726
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:37,577
Actually, Captain, I was thinking
maybe you could take me alone.

727
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,735
As science officer, I
need to learn the ropes,

728
00:52:41,737 --> 00:52:45,937
and I could use your close attention.

729
00:52:51,857 --> 00:52:52,937
Good.

730
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:57,377
Yes, good idea.

731
00:53:20,977 --> 00:53:22,255
Atmosphere's good.

732
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:25,937
Over there.

733
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,897
From here, the shuttle
appears to be deserted.

734
00:53:37,977 --> 00:53:41,177
We'll scout the area, check
for any life forms. Daly out.

735
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:48,895
Cole, we should head
out this way. Cole...

736
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:50,857
It's kind of hot here, don't you think?

737
00:53:51,577 --> 00:53:53,295
Oh, my God.

738
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,215
What are you doing, Cole?

739
00:53:55,217 --> 00:53:57,417
The water looks so inviting, doesn't it?

740
00:53:58,577 --> 00:54:00,817
What are you talking about?

741
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:04,775
Come on, Robert.

742
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:06,855
Ooh!

743
00:54:06,857 --> 00:54:09,577
Oh, the water is great.

744
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:13,175
Swimming is a leisure activity.

745
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:15,455
We're on Space Fleet duty.

746
00:54:15,457 --> 00:54:16,537
You know what?

747
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:21,775
We could always say
that I started drowning

748
00:54:21,777 --> 00:54:26,217
and you had to come in and rescue me.

749
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:27,857
Yeah?

750
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:32,095
Oh, what about that?

751
00:54:32,097 --> 00:54:34,455
Come on. Come on in.

752
00:54:34,457 --> 00:54:37,335
I... Cole.

753
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:40,377
- Come on.
- Cole.

754
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:42,577
Come on.

755
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:46,697
Come on in, my big captain.

756
00:54:49,337 --> 00:54:50,657
OK.

757
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:54,337
Come on.

758
00:54:56,017 --> 00:54:57,457
Are you gonna take all day?

759
00:54:58,977 --> 00:55:00,257
OK.

760
00:55:01,057 --> 00:55:03,777
OK, I'm coming in.

761
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,057
OK, gotta patch it in.

762
00:55:17,577 --> 00:55:19,375
It worked. I'm connected.

763
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:22,215
- Gonna access her PhotoCloud account.
- You remember that password?

764
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:26,215
Uppercase Y998, lowercase
gb7, uppercase TY ampersand 4.

765
00:55:26,217 --> 00:55:27,497
Secure choice.

766
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:34,257
There are thousands of images.
This could take a while.

767
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:38,175
Boring life.

768
00:55:50,497 --> 00:55:52,497
Goddamn.

769
00:55:53,257 --> 00:55:56,897
That is... gymnastic physique.

770
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:59,977
It's nice... nice bedding.

771
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:09,095
Oh. OK, should I keep scrolling?

772
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:10,737
Any of the last nine would do.

773
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:16,297
Ow!

774
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:19,597
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

775
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,655
- Um, are you heading out for the night?
- Yes.

776
00:56:21,657 --> 00:56:23,305
Because it's Christmas Eve and we've

777
00:56:23,308 --> 00:56:25,175
got ten days off work
to recover from it.

778
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:26,375
Go home.

779
00:56:26,377 --> 00:56:27,885
I will. I just have to finish...

780
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:29,895
Yeah, whatever. Merry Christmas, loser.

781
00:56:29,897 --> 00:56:32,937
Yeah. OK, Merry Christmas.

782
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:44,137
Oh, my God.

783
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,417
Elliott, you fucking asshole.

784
00:57:00,577 --> 00:57:03,495
Nanette Cole, we've hacked
your PhotoCloud account

785
00:57:03,497 --> 00:57:07,015
and have control of the entire
contents of your photo gallery.

786
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:09,217
Who is this? Um...

787
00:57:10,017 --> 00:57:11,655
What do you want?

788
00:57:11,657 --> 00:57:14,935
What we want is for you
to do exactly as instructed

789
00:57:14,937 --> 00:57:16,335
or your entire gallery

790
00:57:16,337 --> 00:57:18,577
will be shared with your
friends and your family.

791
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:20,815
And PornHub.

792
00:57:20,817 --> 00:57:22,175
OK, yeah.

793
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:24,217
I'll do what you want, anything.

794
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:26,415
I'll do anything.

795
00:57:26,417 --> 00:57:28,695
Then listen carefully.
We don't have much time.

796
00:57:28,697 --> 00:57:31,335
Stand up, get your coat
and follow our instructions.

797
00:57:31,337 --> 00:57:32,255
OK.

798
00:57:34,377 --> 00:57:36,817
- Where are we going?
- We're just swimming.

799
00:57:37,857 --> 00:57:39,375
It's nice, right?

800
00:57:39,377 --> 00:57:41,215
- Yes.
- Yeah.

801
00:57:41,217 --> 00:57:43,775
We should probably head back.

802
00:57:43,777 --> 00:57:46,975
Help! Something grabbed me, I think.

803
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:50,015
No, it didn't. I don't think
anything did. I'm sorry.

804
00:57:50,017 --> 00:57:53,137
I think I imagined it. So stupid.

805
00:57:55,617 --> 00:57:56,897
That's funny...

806
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:09,017
- That's funny.
- Yeah, it is funny. It's funny.

807
00:58:15,217 --> 00:58:16,217
Easy, Cole.

808
00:58:27,577 --> 00:58:30,175
- All right, I'm in position.
- OK, we're gonna hang up now.

809
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:32,895
Make the phone call. Be sure to
complete the rest of your mission.

810
00:58:32,897 --> 00:58:34,257
- I will.
- You better.

811
00:58:35,017 --> 00:58:37,897
OK, I'll send it back down.

812
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:55,057
Oh! Hi.

813
00:58:57,737 --> 00:58:59,417
This is fucking crazy.

814
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:04,615
Fenzi's.

815
00:59:04,617 --> 00:59:06,735
Yes, I'd like to order a pizza.

816
00:59:06,737 --> 00:59:07,737
Sure. What do you want?

817
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:30,777
Oop.

818
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:33,057
I guess you'd better get that.

819
00:59:34,377 --> 00:59:36,215
See who...

820
00:59:37,697 --> 00:59:39,015
- Hold on.
- Yeah.

821
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:52,057
- It's the door.
- Oh, OK.

822
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,337
Pause game.

823
01:00:08,857 --> 01:00:11,377
- Dudani, pick me up.
- You got it. Stand by.

824
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:17,737
Coming.

825
01:00:33,577 --> 01:00:36,015
- Hello?
- Uh, pizza.

826
01:00:36,017 --> 01:00:37,097
I didn't order a pizza.

827
01:00:37,737 --> 01:00:40,695
OK, look, someone did, OK? So
do you want it or not? Because...

828
01:00:40,697 --> 01:00:42,937
I can't take it back.

829
01:00:47,817 --> 01:00:49,697
What the hell am I doing?

830
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,337
All right!

831
01:00:58,577 --> 01:00:59,857
OK.

832
01:01:01,217 --> 01:01:04,377
That's the signal. She's got the DNA.

833
01:01:05,177 --> 01:01:07,815
All of it. Tommy too.

834
01:01:09,497 --> 01:01:11,650
Packer, we ready to fly?

835
01:01:11,653 --> 01:01:12,777
Uh-huh.

836
01:01:15,337 --> 01:01:16,255
Well?

837
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:19,895
You're supposed to say something
like "engage" or "increase thrust."

838
01:01:19,897 --> 01:01:22,017
Just fucking go.

839
01:01:27,297 --> 01:01:30,417
There you go. So I got
it here in under ten.

840
01:01:31,257 --> 01:01:33,455
There's supposed to be 30 in it for me.

841
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:36,937
Yeah. What's happening?
The door is closing. Hello?

842
01:01:38,017 --> 01:01:40,095
Hello? Hello?

843
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:41,615
Shit...

844
01:01:41,617 --> 01:01:42,657
Come on, man.

845
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:47,177
Hello? Come on, man, you promised.

846
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,937
Nice. Nice. Merry Christmas, asshole!

847
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:39,897
Resume game.

848
01:02:52,817 --> 01:02:54,417
Resume game.

849
01:03:01,097 --> 01:03:04,497
Can't we go any faster? That dud
disk isn't gonna fool him forever.

850
01:03:05,137 --> 01:03:06,806
The update is gonna complete before

851
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:08,615
long and that means bye-bye, wormhole.

852
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:11,577
The only quicker route is
through that asteroid belt there.

853
01:03:12,102 --> 01:03:14,140
- Let's go that way.
- No, it's way too dense.

854
01:03:14,143 --> 01:03:16,775
If the ship broke up we wouldn't
die, we'd just be left in space.

855
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:18,583
Until Daly works out what's happening.

856
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,575
Then he'll find us
and he'll fuck us over.

857
01:03:35,657 --> 01:03:38,657
Resume game.

858
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:41,977
Lieutenant Cole, we should head...

859
01:03:43,857 --> 01:03:45,257
Cole?

860
01:03:48,297 --> 01:03:50,575
Daly to bridge. What's going on?

861
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,815
- Shit. He has a backup disk.
- Come in, bridge.

862
01:03:52,817 --> 01:03:55,137
No, don't answer him.

863
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:57,057
Dudani?

864
01:04:03,497 --> 01:04:04,737
God damn it.

865
01:04:06,017 --> 01:04:08,975
The wormhole, it's decreasing in size.

866
01:04:08,977 --> 01:04:10,895
Upload must be in the last few percent.

867
01:04:10,897 --> 01:04:13,777
Damn it, Packer, we are gonna
have to go through the belt.

868
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,497
Do you think that you can do that?

869
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:19,537
- Think I can try.
- OK.

870
01:04:45,137 --> 01:04:48,655
- Ship's computer on.
- Computer, where's the USS Callister?

871
01:04:48,657 --> 01:04:51,817
USS Callister is on course.

872
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:54,697
- On course for where?
- The wormhole.

873
01:04:55,897 --> 01:04:58,737
- What wormhole?
- The update vortex.

874
01:05:01,537 --> 01:05:03,737
Sons of bitches!

875
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,697
Prepare for takeoff.

876
01:05:24,904 --> 01:05:26,403
I've got a heat signature.

877
01:05:26,406 --> 01:05:28,322
Looks like a shuttle
took off from Skillane IV.

878
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:29,599
Oh, God, it's Daly.

879
01:05:37,297 --> 01:05:38,895
Shields at 86%.

880
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,137
We're taking a beating here!

881
01:05:45,697 --> 01:05:47,335
Incoming transmission.

882
01:05:47,337 --> 01:05:50,335
Hello? Loyal trusty crew, come in.

883
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:52,057
I know you can hear me.

884
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:55,535
Whatever it is you think
you're going to do won't work,

885
01:05:55,537 --> 01:05:56,815
but it is going to cost you!

886
01:05:56,817 --> 01:05:58,918
- Let's go faster.
- Already at maximum.

887
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,546
Daly can't touch us unless he makes it

888
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:02,255
on board, and that's shuttle's a jalopy.

889
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:04,257
- He won't catch us in time.
- I hope you're right.

890
01:06:08,337 --> 01:06:09,537
Shields 58%.

891
01:06:17,497 --> 01:06:18,917
If you thought what happened to you

892
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,654
in the past was bad, that was nothing!

893
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:25,255
What I'm going to do to you is
going to be goddamn fucking biblical!

894
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:28,295
I'm literally going to
turn your insides out.

895
01:06:28,297 --> 01:06:33,775
But I'll keep you alive
in tiny little jars

896
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:35,655
and there you'll stay
until I'm bored of you...

897
01:06:35,657 --> 01:06:38,095
- Why are we listening to this?
- Yes, fuck him!

898
01:06:39,177 --> 01:06:41,857
We're at the edge of the belt.
I think we're gonna make it.

899
01:06:56,097 --> 01:06:59,495
- What was that?
- Primary drive.

900
01:06:59,497 --> 01:07:02,537
I've lost all thrust.
Engines not responding.

901
01:07:04,777 --> 01:07:06,257
We're drifting here.

902
01:07:09,617 --> 01:07:13,497
USS Callister has lost engine power.

903
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:20,417
I'm coming to get you! Hello!

904
01:07:21,857 --> 01:07:24,655
Is there any way that
we can fix the engines?

905
01:07:24,657 --> 01:07:29,255
That's only feasible manually,
by climbing inside the jet fader.

906
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:30,335
So...?

907
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,495
So you'd burn to a crisp
when the jet came on.

908
01:07:32,497 --> 01:07:37,937
- We'd burn without dying.
- So one of us needs to go. OK.

909
01:07:38,697 --> 01:07:40,895
One of us already has.

910
01:07:40,897 --> 01:07:41,975
Walton?

911
01:07:41,977 --> 01:07:43,935
I'm pretty sure I can fix this.

912
01:07:43,937 --> 01:07:47,297
Um, uh... Walton, are
you sure about this?

913
01:07:48,057 --> 01:07:49,657
I'm sure.

914
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:53,655
Tulaska, can you patch
me through to Daly?

915
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:55,177
Patching through.

916
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:58,457
Hey, Daly, can you hear me?

917
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:02,175
- Walton?
- Robert? Hey.

918
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:04,455
- Walton, you're going to pay for this.
- Robert, listen.

919
01:08:04,457 --> 01:08:06,455
- I'm going to bring Tommy back in.
- Hey, Robert...

920
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:10,335
God so help me, you are going
to regret all of this so hard!

921
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:12,337
Bob, I wanna talk to you here!

922
01:08:13,497 --> 01:08:15,137
I was thinking I should say...

923
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:18,497
sorry.

924
01:08:22,256 --> 01:08:23,256
Go on.

925
01:08:26,057 --> 01:08:29,497
You created Infinity.
You're a fucking genius.

926
01:08:30,817 --> 01:08:32,615
I exploited that.

927
01:08:32,617 --> 01:08:35,855
I treated you like a golden goose
and I got fat on the profits,

928
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:37,375
figuratively speaking.

929
01:08:39,577 --> 01:08:45,055
And I was thinking I should have
appreciated you more, you know?

930
01:08:45,057 --> 01:08:46,857
I should have treated you better.

931
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:51,377
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking
I should say all that.

932
01:08:55,977 --> 01:09:00,777
But you threw my son out of an
airlock, so fuck you to death.

933
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:08,977
Walton?

934
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:10,817
Walton?

935
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,097
We've got power back.

936
01:09:28,057 --> 01:09:30,575
- Faster!
- Speed already at maximum.

937
01:09:30,577 --> 01:09:32,697
I don't care, whatever, just catch them!

938
01:09:36,296 --> 01:09:39,375
Wormhole almost closed.
Daly's gaining on us.

939
01:09:39,377 --> 01:09:42,615
- Keep her steady. Keep steady.
- I'm trying.

940
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:44,097
Come on, come on.

941
01:09:45,977 --> 01:09:47,977
I hope we are going to die.

942
01:10:09,377 --> 01:10:10,497
Goddamn it!

943
01:10:12,137 --> 01:10:14,537
Damn it! Fuck!

944
01:10:48,097 --> 01:10:49,257
What happened?

945
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:52,935
The mod's gone.

946
01:10:52,937 --> 01:10:55,695
Daly's Space Fleet mod has been
stripped away by the firewall.

947
01:10:55,697 --> 01:10:59,535
- OK, so... this is good.
- We're still alive.

948
01:10:59,537 --> 01:11:01,617
Yeah, it only erased
the Space Fleet mod.

949
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:05,455
We're not on Daly's computer anymore.

950
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:08,815
- We're in the cloud.
- Where is Daly?

951
01:11:08,817 --> 01:11:12,417
Firewall's deleted his rogue game
code, and his controls were disabled.

952
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:15,777
- You mean...?
- He's stuck there.

953
01:11:19,497 --> 01:11:22,615
Update complete. Wormhole closed.

954
01:11:24,897 --> 01:11:26,777
- Controls are disabled.
- No.

955
01:11:28,177 --> 01:11:30,615
No. No, no, no!

956
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:33,215
- Assholes!
- Hey!

957
01:11:33,217 --> 01:11:35,975
- Yeah! What's up?
- The brig unlocked itself.

958
01:11:35,977 --> 01:11:38,335
My Valdack outfit turned into this.

959
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,375
More to the point, I'm
not a beetle thing anymore.

960
01:11:40,377 --> 01:11:41,735
I've got my body back.

961
01:11:41,737 --> 01:11:44,537
I've got my whole body back.
I'm guessing we all have.

962
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:47,855
So what do we do now?

963
01:11:47,857 --> 01:11:51,055
We've got an infinite procedurally
generated universe at our disposal.

964
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,537
We can go anywhere.

965
01:11:54,297 --> 01:11:56,297
Holy mackerel.

966
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:13,255
Rogue universe detected.

967
01:12:13,257 --> 01:12:15,375
Deletion in progress.
Deletion in progress.

968
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:17,335
- No, undelete.
- Deletion in progress.

969
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:19,735
- Undelete. Un...
- Rogue universe detected.

970
01:12:19,737 --> 01:12:21,375
- Deletion in progress.
- Exit game.

971
01:12:21,377 --> 01:12:24,895
- Deletion in progress.
- Rogue universe detected.

972
01:12:24,897 --> 01:12:27,935
Exit game. Exit game!

973
01:12:30,337 --> 01:12:33,135
Exit fucking game!

974
01:12:33,137 --> 01:12:34,937
Exit fucking game!

975
01:12:35,577 --> 01:12:37,777
Exit fucking game!

976
01:12:39,217 --> 01:12:41,952
Exit fucking game! Exit fucking game!

977
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:35,177
Incoming transmission.

978
01:13:36,577 --> 01:13:39,455
- It says Gamer691.
- That's a player tag.

979
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:41,175
Another ship, another player.

980
01:13:41,177 --> 01:13:43,695
We're online. Um...

981
01:13:43,697 --> 01:13:46,057
Hey, patch 'em through.

982
01:13:47,897 --> 01:13:49,815
- Um, hello.
- Hey there.

983
01:13:49,817 --> 01:13:53,295
Uh, this is the crew
of the USS Callister.

984
01:13:53,297 --> 01:13:56,495
Oh, man, are we glad to hear from...

985
01:13:56,497 --> 01:13:58,116
Yeah, Merry Christmas. So are we gonna

986
01:13:58,119 --> 01:13:59,735
blow each other or are we gonna trade?

987
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:02,615
Oh... Hmm.

988
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:05,495
Hello. Do you have
anything to trade at all?

989
01:14:05,497 --> 01:14:08,535
- No, uh...
- So why did you respond?

990
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:12,535
OK, just get the hell out of my
quadrant or I'll blast you to shit.

991
01:14:12,537 --> 01:14:15,095
- You got ten seconds. Ten...
- Oh, well, do... do try.

992
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:17,935
We'll photon-bolt you up the
perineum, you stupid little boy.

993
01:14:17,937 --> 01:14:19,495
- Scary. Nine.
- Come on, then.

994
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,455
- Yes, thank you, Shania. Um...
- Eight.

995
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,535
- Nate?
- Yes, Captain?

996
01:14:23,537 --> 01:14:25,055
Stick us in hyperwarp and let's...

997
01:14:25,057 --> 01:14:26,615
- Six.
- Fuck off somewhere.

998
01:14:26,617 --> 01:14:28,215
- Five.
- Aye aye, Captain.

999
01:14:28,217 --> 01:14:29,895
- Really, Nanette is fine.
- Four.

1000
01:14:29,897 --> 01:14:32,617
- Aye aye, Nanette.
- Three.

1001
01:14:33,377 --> 01:14:36,615
Two. One!

1002
01:14:36,617 --> 01:14:40,337
Uh-huh. You'd better run.
King of space right here.

1003
01:14:42,884 --> 01:14:44,724
King of space.

1004
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:50,200
