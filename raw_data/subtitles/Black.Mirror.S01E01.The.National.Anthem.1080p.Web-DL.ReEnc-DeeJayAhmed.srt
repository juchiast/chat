00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:48,917
Hello.

2
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:53,886
Just tell me what's happened.

3
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,558
And what is it?

4
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:03,746
I'll be right down.

5
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:06,777
What's happened?

6
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:10,410
Susannah.

7
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:12,027
Susannah?

8
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:14,597
Princess Susannah.

9
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,402
Is she all right?

10
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:19,519
Don't know.

What are you doing? Keep it going.

31
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:14,339
Prime Minister, at this point,
I think it's important to say

32
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,895
that we are 100% certain

33
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:19,135
that this is, indeed,

34
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:20,503
Princess Susannah.

35
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,887
Her car was intercepted
shortly after midnight,

36
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:26,826
returning from the wedding
of a college friend.

37
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,668
She'd insisted on going.

38
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:30,523
But you had security on her?

39
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,855
Two PPOs, still unconscious.

40
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:36,191
Heavy sedative, close range,
each with a single puncture wound.

41
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:37,941
No sign of struggle.

42
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:48,090
Scrap Third World debt?

43
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,375
Save the fucking libraries?

44
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:57,207
We are convinced both the video and
the demand it contains are genuine.

45
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,332
What demand?

46
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:00,629
What Susannah says next...

47
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:05,160
It concerns you directly, sir.

48
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,910
Just play it.

49
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:16,434
'There is only one demand,

the broadcast.

It's real.

She said pig.

64
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,800
Sex with a pig.

65
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,949

But what...? Who...?

69
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:50,785
We're checking with embedded operatives,
compiling a list of suspects.

70
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,379
Meanwhile, the demand has been made.

71
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,269
There's not long
to formulate our response.

72
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,589
Well, I'm not fucking a pig!

73
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:02,097
Page one, that's not happening.

74
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:04,597
Of course.

75
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:13,777
Absolutely, sir.

76
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,144
Well, have we established a dialogue
with this...?

77
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,457
We can't. There's no
e-mail address, no code word.

78
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,256
No channel for negotiation.

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,255
So we focus on finding Susannah.
We get her back.

80
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,402
However it's done, I don't care.
We stop this now.

81
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,699
Everyone's working towards this.

82
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:37,673
Yes. No. Not everyone. A dedicated
core team. This can't go wide.

83
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:41,425
Keep it so far from the press
it's on the other side of Jupiter.

84
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:44,918
This only exists in this room.

85
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:47,605
It's already outside it.

86

If there are hacks sniffing around,
shut them down, bright, red, D Notice.

Super fucking Godzilla injunction
with ten-inch Whitehall fangs!

88
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,836
This video came from YouTube.

89
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,442
What?

90
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:06,135
It was uploaded via an encrypted IP
an hour ago.

91
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:07,416
Well, get it off there!

92
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:12,774
We did after nine minutes, long enough
for it to be duplicated and spread.

93
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:16,763
Spread?
How many people have seen this?

94
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,295
We take down one,
six clones pop up elsewhere.

95
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,623
How many people?

96
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:23,794
50,000. That's our current estimate.

97
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:27,818
The news rooms have got it.

98
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,596
They're running this on air?

99
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:33,403
No. We put a type five D notice out
and they're complying.

100
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,794
For now.

101
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,656

What now? What's the play book?

104
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:48,626
This is virgin territory,
Prime Minister.

105
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:51,142
There's no play book.

106
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:13,257
Princess Susannah's been kidnapped!

107
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,719
You scared the shit out of me!

108

'I don't understand!'

114
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,602

How do we describe it?
"An indecent act"?

118
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:43,297
Everyone's seen the video.
They know the details.

119
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:46,854
If we mention bestiality
Ofcom would be pissed off.

We're observing the D Notice.

122
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,488
Surely we're going to do something.

We are honouring the D Notice.

124

The voluntary D Notice!

125
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:55,742
It may be a sportsman-like
gesture but we are making it.

126
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,527
A woman's life is at stake!

127
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:59,778
We follow the procedure.

128

My timeline consists
of 100% viewers asking

129
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:05,416
why we're not covering it.
How do I reply?

130
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:06,213
You don't.

131
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:07,690
That is totally backwards.

132
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,236
No-one else has broken rank.

is pretty comprehensive!

135

Maybe

136
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:16,869
It's like 9/11's happening and

137
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,471
we're broadcasting sandwich recipes.

138

We're not a chat room!

139
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:23,476
It's on CNN and Fox.

140
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:27,039
And MSNBC, Al Jazeera, NHK...

141

All right.

OK, Sarah, cover the snatch itself.

Damon, public reaction. Meera,

the royal angle, upcoming marriage,
etc.

146
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,297
Simon, set tone with
Standards and Practices.

147
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,763
We need to explain this without
viewers sicking up their Weetabix.

148
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:49,857
Ken, the internet aspect, new paradigm,
Twitter, Arab spring, all that.

149
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:53,593
Dan, all graphics run past me.
Keep it functional... no Peppa Pigs.

150
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,445
Malaika,
update the princess obit VT.

151
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:58,195
The Obit VT?

152
00:09:58,218 --> 00:10:01,500
Mm-hm. First, an awkward phone call.
Least I can do is warn Tom.

153
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,016
We put a D Notice on it.

154
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:09,138
'It's gone global, Tom.'

155
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,417
Don't. I'm begging you.

156
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:13,417
Don't run it, Martin.

157
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:15,857
'Look, I'm sorry. I can't help you.'

158
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,395
You know how much help
you're getting hereon in?

159
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:22,336
Multiply nothing by shit-all!
UKN are dead for us!

160
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,423
Shove it up your arse you fucking...

161
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,475
Interesting.

162
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:27,537
A man.

163
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:28,475
Man?

164
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:29,509
A man!

165
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:32,458
Tom, so you're across it...

166
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,744
I'm exploring contingency plans.

167

'I briefed Callett.'

168
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,018
Mr Callett.
Noel, from Blue Eye.

169
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,038
Noel won an Emmy by his effects
work on that HBO moon Western thing.

170

Sea Of Tranquillity.

171
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:51,788
You won't find better.

172
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:54,297
Can you map a head onto a body live?

173
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:55,538
Depends if your camera's moving.

174
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:00,907
Rule sheet specifies a single hand-held
camera in a constant roving motion.

175
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:02,251
Mm.

176
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:05,360
Yeah, Gonzo style.
He knows his shit. That's tough.

in full"?

178
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:13,098
Focus on the visuals. Different face
mapped onto a live performer.

179
00:11:13,437 --> 00:11:14,999
According to those stipulations.

180
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,764
Fringes of possibility...

181
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:19,874
Deadline's at four. We need to know
if it's workable by two.

182
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:25,578
Can't happen.

183
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,497
It has to.

184
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:31,417
Our embeds have ruled out the major
players. It's not AQ, not IRA.

185

For more than questioning, I hope.

189

less waste lying around... '

192
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,537
Nothing. Must be a hoax.

193
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:59,977

00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,667
Looks like it had lights on.

324
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:27,308
We got him. We got him.

325
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:30,511
Alert the local team.
Full squad. I'll man it.

326
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:33,863
With helmet-cam relay.
We can watch the operation.

327
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:35,730
Press office, OK, Tom?

328
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:42,652
Yes!

329
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,057
Right. Confident?

330
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,217
It's a kick-bollock scramble,
but with finessing it should be OK.

331
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:08,538
Finesse quickly.
Our performer's on his way.

332
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:19,097
It's a new one for me, obviously.
I wouldn't normally... You know.

333
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:21,097
You seen any of my films?

334
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:21,992
No.

335
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:24,984
I'm pretty trad... bish, bash, bosh.
In, out.

336
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,641
Yeah, well...

337
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:28,977
What do I put on the invoice?
That's what I'm wondering.

338
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:30,268
There won't be any invoicing.

339
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:33,494
- Oi-oi, Rod!
- Oi-oi!

340
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:37,897
Need to prep two statements

341
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,376
Good outcome. Bad outcome.

342
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:40,601
Rescue operation?

343
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,554
Goon squad's heading
for postcode in Buckinghamshire.

344
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:47,698
HP84TD, a college or something.
They should be there by now.

345
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:14,737
Yeah, I've reduced
the luminance...

346
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:17,097
Agent Callett, this is Mr Flynn.

347
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:19,377
AKA, Rod Senseless.

348

Stage name.

349
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,177
Yeah. Well...

350
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:27,297
You need to get into this.

351
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,145
Is there a dressing room I can use?

352
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,498
No.

353
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,417
Where's my co-star?

354
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,723
Be rude not to give her a kiss
beforehand.

355
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:37,082
Outside in the truck.

356
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,824
Full of joie de vivre, isn't he?

357
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:46,738
You also need to wear this...
on your head.

358
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,346
Board's been prised away.
That's where they got in.

359
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,692
OK.

360
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,658
'Target identified.'

361
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:01,871

'Any orders, boss?'

Do you think I'd be here
if they had?

370

We've got statements
for either outcome.

371
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:34,804
Listen,
coverage is very sympathetic.

372
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:36,601
Can't think about coverage now!

373
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:44,542
But it's on-side?

374
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,041
Strong undercurrent of sympathy.

375

Every poll indicates
understanding, disgust with the

376

captor, outrage at the whole
thing, but not at you.

377

If Walker's team fuck up, I'm not
saying they will, but if they do,

378
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:04,098
the public anticipates
non-compliance.

379
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:08,307
There'll be squawks from the usuals,

380
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,488
but it's not "England expects".

381

485
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:28,264
UKN. It's Malaika something
or other. She's from UKN.

486
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:29,578
You press? Yes.

487
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:33,657
There goes your RTS Award.

488
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:35,737
There must be something.

489
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:36,566
There's nothing there, Mike.

490
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:37,897
There'll be a clue.
Some evidence.

491
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:38,938
We've done all we can.

492
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:41,377
You rescued mannequin.

493
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,285
I'm sorry, Michael...

494
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:43,412
Fuck off, Julian!

495
00:29:43,453 --> 00:29:45,076
20 past three. We're out of time.

496
00:29:45,081 --> 00:29:47,068
We're not out of time!

497
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:49,193
We're not out of time.

498
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:06,937
It's not going to happen.

499
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:07,456
To the public...

500
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,338
Fuck the public!

501
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:13,217
To the public, this would be one man
of questionable popularity

502
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:15,458
putting personal embarrassment
over the life of a girl.

503
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:17,697
They will not release her anyway.
She's probably already dead.

504
00:30:17,698 --> 00:30:20,614
If she isn't,
he'll kill her and upload the video.

505
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:25,577
Everyone will see it.
The world will see it.

506
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:29,897
The mood will border on insurrection
and you will be destroyed,

507
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:33,018
I guarantee you...
utterly destroyed.

508
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,623
The polling bears that out.

509
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:44,857
You won't just be
a disgraced politician,

510
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:49,977
The public, the Palace and the Party
insist on compliance.

511
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:51,237
Fuck the Party!

512
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:54,024
Refuse, and I've been advised

513
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:56,657
that we cannot guarantee
your physical safety.

514
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,300
Or that of your family.

515
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:03,887
But...

516
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:15,761
I've made arrangements
for the broadcast.

517
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,078
I can't...

518
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,925
I'm sorry, Michael.
It's out of your hands.

519

any recording or images of the event.

526

They're doing an announcement

527
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,702

tone that causes nausea.

is that you should take

It's just
a skeleton crew inside.

It's history, this.

Stumbling about in the city.

Sedated. She can't remember
anything, but she's unharmed.

But her finger?

576
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,897
Not hers. DNA shows it's male.

577
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:30,903
What?

578
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:36,224
There is one other thing. There's a
CCTV grab of her from half three.

579
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:40,457
It seems he let her go
30 minutes before it happened.

580
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:43,014
Why?

581
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:44,671
My guess...

582
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:46,272
he knew everyone would
be elsewhere

583
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,530
watching screens.

584
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,581
So it's a statement.

585
00:40:51,628 --> 00:40:52,995
Ma'am?

586
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,130
That's what this was all about,
making a point.

587
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,018
Should we, er...?

588
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:00,087
Lose that page of the report.

589

No-one sees it, especially the PM.

590
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:04,658
Of course.

591
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,711
Good news, Michael.
